# Embedded systems

- A computer system that is designed to perform a specific, dedicated function, such as a microcontroller.

  - Hardware and software designed for a specific function



- Is built with only this task in mind, can be optimized for size and/or cost



- **Example** Common light controllers, digital watches 



# SoC (System on a chip)

- Multiple components running on a single chip



- Small form-factor, extgernal interface support, Cache memory, flash memory, low power concumption. 

  - **Example** is a raspberry pi.



# Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)

- An intergrated circut that can be configured after manufacturing

  - A problem doesn't require a hardware replacement, Reporgram the FPGA. 



- Common in infrastructure, Firewall logic, routers. 



# SCADA / ICS

- Supervisory Control and Data Acquistion System, Large-scale, multi-site industrial control systems

  - Pc manages equipment

  - Distributed control systems

  - Requires extensive segmentation, No access from the outside 



# IoT

- Internet of Things, Heating and cooling. Sensors

  - Smart devices, Home automation, video doorbells

  - Wearable technology, Watches, health monitors

  - Facility automation 



- Not made for security. IoT devices can be seprate from the home network just in case someone gains access 

  - Weak defualts 





# Specialized

- Medical devices, Heart monitor, insulin pumps. 

- Vehicles, the internal network is often accessible from mobile networks

- Aircraft, DoS could damage the aircraft

- Smart meters, Measure power, and water usage 



# VoIP

- Voice over internet protocol 

  - A relatively complex embedded system, Can be relatively important

  -  Each device is a computer, Separate boot



# HVAC 

- Heating Ventilation, and Conditioning

  - A complex science, Not something you can properly design

  - Pc manages equipment, Security is not in mind.



# Drones

- FLying vehicle, no pilot on board

  - May be manually controlled, Often with some autonomy 

  - Extensive commercial and non-commercial use 



# Multifunction devices (MFD)

- No longer a simple printer, Very sophisticated firmware

  - Some images are store locally on the device

  - Logs are stored on the device which a hacker can access



# RTOS ( Real-time Operating System)

- An operating system with a deterministic processing schedule

  - Industrial equipment, automobiles 

  - Military environments

  - Extremely sensitive to security issues



# Surveillance systems

- Video/audio surveillance, embedded system are in the cameras

  - Secure the security system, Do support firmware upgrades 



# 5g

- 5 generations cellular networking, Launched worldwide 2020



- Significant performance improvements, High frequencies



- Significant IoT impact, Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint 



# Subscriber identity module (SIM)

- A universal integrated circuit 

  - Used to provide information to a cellular network provider

  - contains mobile details, IMSI ( International mobile subscriber identity)



# Narrowband

- Communicate analog signals over a narrow range of frequencies, Over a long-range distance

  - Many IoT (internet of things) communicate 



# Baseband

- Generally a single cable with a digital signal 



- The communication signal used all the bandwidth



- Bidirectional communication, using the same wire/fiber



- Ethernet standard 



# Zigbee 

- Internet of things networking, Open standard

  - Alternative to WiFi and Bluetooth, Longer distances than Bluetooth

  - Mesh network of all Zigbee devices in your home, Tell Amazon Echo to lock the door



# Uses the ISM band

- Industrial Scientific, and Medical
