# Barricades / bollard

- Prevent access, there are limits to the prevention



- Channel people through a specific access point



- Identify safety concerns



- Can be used to an extreme 



# Access control vestibules

- Opening one door causes others to lock 

  - All doors are normally locked, Unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked 



- One door open/other locked

  - One at a time, controlled groups 



# Alarms

- Circuit based- Circuit is opened or closed



- Door, Window, Fence



- USeful on the perimeter



- Motion detection, Radio frequencies 



- Duress, Triggered by a person 



# Signs 

- Clear and specific instructions



- Keep people away from restricted areas



# Video surveillance 

- CCTV (Closed-circuit television) 



- Camera features are important



- Motion recognition can alarm and alert when something moves



- Often many different cameras



# Industrial camouflage 

- Conceal an important facility in plain sight 

  - Protect a data center, No business signs, visual clues, Surround it with a water feature



# Guards and access lists

- Security guard, Physical protection at the reception area of a facility 



- ID badge, Picture name, and other details

  - Must be worn at all times 



# Guards 

- Two-person integrity/control



- Minimize exposure to an attack



- NO single person has access to a physical asset



- Robot sentries, Monitoring, rounds/periodic checks 



# Biometrics 

- Biometric authentication, Fingerprint, retina, voiceprint

  - Usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometric



- Difficult to change 

  - Used in very specific situations 



# Door access controls

-Conventional 



- Deadbolt

- Electronic

  - Token-based



# Cable locks

- Temporary security, connect your hardware

  - Cable works almost anywhere



- Most devices have a standard connector



# USB data blocker

- Don't connect unknown USB interfaces 



- Use a USB data blocker, allow voltage, and reject data



- Use your power adapter, avoid the issue entirely 



# Proper lighting

- More light means more security

  - Specialized design 



# Fencing

- Build a perimeter

  - Transparent or opaque, see through the fence (or not) 

  - Robust, Difficult to cut the fence

  - Prevent climbing



# Fire suppression

- Electronics require unique responses to fire

  - Detection, Smoke detector, Flame detector, Heat detector

  - Suppress with water 



# Sensors 

- Motion detection

  - Identify movement in an area 



- Noise detection

  - Recognize an increase in sound



- Proximity reader

  - Commonly used with electronic door



- Moisture detection



# Drones

-  Quickly cover large areas



- More than physical security

  - Site survey or damage assessments



# Faraday case

- Blocks electromagnetic fields



- A mesh of conductive material 



- Not a comprehensive solution 



# Screened subnet

- Formerly known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ)

  - An additional layer of security between the internet

> A screened host



# Protected distribution 

- Protected Distribution System (PDS)

  - Protect your cables and fibers 

  - Prevent cable and fiber taps



# Secure areas

- Physically secure the data, As important as the digital security

  - An important part of a security policy



- Secure active operaions

  - Secure offline data



# Air gap

- Physical separation between networks



- Most environments are shared, Shared routers, switches, firewalls



- Specialized networks require an air gap, Stock market, SCADA, Airplanes, Nuclear power plants 



# Vaults and safes

- A secure reinforced room



- Store backup media



- Protect from disaster or theft 



# Hot and cold aisles

- Data centers, Lots and lots of equipment 

  -  Optimize cooling, Keep components at optimal temperatures

  - Conserve energy, Data centers are usually very large rooms, FOcus the cooling

# Data destruction and media sanitization

- Disposal becomes a legal issue, Some information must not be destroyed

  - Consider offsite storage



# Protect your rubbish

- Secure your garbage, Fence the lock



- Shred your documents, This will go so far



- Burn documents, no going back



- Pulp the paper, large tank washing to remove ink



# Physical destruction

- Heavy machinery 

  - Drill/Hammer, Quick and easy

  - Electromagnetic ( degaussing )

  - Can also burn digital media



# Certificate of destruction-

- Destruction is often done by a 3rd party

  - A third party confirms that a certificate was destroyed, A paper trail of broken detail



# Sanitizing media

- Purge data, Remove it from an existing datastore



- Delete some of the data from a database



- Wipe data, Unrevoerable removal of data



# Data security

- UK National Health Service, A third party sold data instead of destroying it
