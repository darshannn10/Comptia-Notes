# Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

- A computing method that uses the cloud to provide any or all infrastructure needs.

  - IT resources such as servers, load balancers, are provided in the cloud.



- You are still responsible for the management of the security.

 - Your data is out there, more within your control. You control the operating system 



- Web server providers

  - Microsoft Azure and AWS



# Software as a service (SaaS)

- A computing method that uses the cloud to provide application services to its users. 

  - On-demand software - no local installation

  - Virtual infrastructure allows developers to provision services

  - A complete application offering; No development work required



# Platform as a service (PaaS)

- A computing method that uses the cloud to provide any platform-type services

  - No servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC 



- You don't have direct control of the data, people. or infrastructure



- **Example** Salesforce.com



# Anything as a service (XaaS)

- A broad description of all cloud models



- Services delivered over the internet

  - Flexible consumption model 



- IT becomes more of an operating model 



# Cloud service providers 

- Provide cloud services 

  - SaaS

  - PaaS

  - LaaS 



- Charge a flat fee or based on use 



- You still manage your processes; Internal staff, Development team, Operational support



# Managed service providers (MSP)

- A cloud service provider



- Not all cloud service providers are MSPs



- MSP support is in charge of 

  - Network connectivity management

  - Backups and disaster recovery  



- Manage Security Service Provider ( MSSP )

- Firewall management

- patch management

- security audits



# On-premises 

- Your applications are on local hardware

  - Your servers are in your data center in your building



# Off-premises / hosted

- Your server not in your building

  - They may not even be running your hardware

  - Usually a specialized computing environment '



# Edge computing 

- Provisioning processing resource close to the network edge of IoT devices to reduce latency

  - IoT devices on the internet, Devices with very specific functions. A huge amount of data



- Edge computing, application data is on an edge server ( Local system ). 

  - Often process data on the device itself, No latency, no network requirement



# Fog computing 

- A cloud that is close to your data 



- Cloud + Internet of Things 

  - Extends the cloud, Distributes the data, and processing. No latency, local decisions made from local data 



- Sensitive data never leaves



- The fog is in the middle, the data is sitting there and isn't pushed to the cloud. 



# Thin client 

- Basic application usage; Applications actually run on a remote server, Virtual desktop infrastructure 



- Desktop as a service (DaaS). 



- No huge memory or CPU needs to connect to the cloud, network connectivity



# Virtualization 

- Runs many different operating systems on the same hardware

  - Each application instance has its own operating system

-  Separate operating machines, has a guest operating system



- Virtual machines can become expensive



# Application containerization

- Container; Everything you need to run an application, Code, and dependencies



- An isolated process in a sandbox; self-contained
