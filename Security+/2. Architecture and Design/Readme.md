## <span style="color:#d47500">2.1 Explain use cases and purpose for frameworks, best practices and secure configuration guides.</span>

1. Industry-standard frameworks and reference architectures:
    1. **Framework**: Is a collection of standardized policies, procedures and guides, meant to direct a: user, firm, or any organization.
    2. **Regulatory**: Is a framework that is based on mandated laws and regulations. HIPAA is an example of this.
    3. **Non-regulatory**: The common standards and best practices that the organization follows.
    4. National vs. international:
        1. **National**: Framework based on the laws of a single country.
        2. **International**: Framework based on the laws of multiple countries.
    5. **Industry-specific frameworks**: Frameworks based on the standards and regulations of a certain industry.
2. **Benchmarks/secure configuration guides**: Instructions that have been developed over years that are designed to give organizations the best and most secure configurations for a particular system.
    1. **Platform/vendor-specific guides**: Hardening guides that are specific to the software or platform, also you can get feedback from the manufacturer or internet interest groups. System default configurations are unsecured and at high risk for exploits.
        1. **Web server**: Web application firewall (WAF), DMZ, Reverse Proxy for incoming communication from the internet to the server.
        2. **Operating system**: Implement a change management policy.
        3. **Application server**: Securing an application server means using industry standard guides, vendor specific, locking down the server to only the ports it needs for its specific role.
        4. **Network infrastructure devices**: Use national vs international guides, regulatory/non-regulatory and general purpose guides for securing.
    2. **General purpose guides**: Security configuration guides that are generic in scope.
3. Defense-in-depth/layered security:
    1. **Vendor diversity**: The practice of implementing security controls from different vendors to increase security. Reduces the impact of company specific vulnerabilities.
    2. **Control diversity**: The use of technical controls, administrative controls, and physical controls to harden security.

    2. **Extranet**: Private network that can only be accessed by authorized individuals. Links a company with its suppliers and customers.  
    
    3. **Intranet**: A private network that exclusively for the use of the members of the organization, cannot be accessed by anyone outside the organization.  
      
    4. **Wireless**: Generally, requires a login, an example is an internal wireless network at work.
    5. **Guest**: Network with access to the internet but no access to the internal network. Is useful in congested areas and is generally unsecured.
    6. **Honeynets**: Dummy Network to attract and fool attackers.
    7. **NAT** (Network Address Translation): Translates private IP addresses in to public and public IP addresses to private.
    8. **Ad hoc**: A wireless network without an access point, the connected devices communicate directly.
2. **Segregation/segmentation/isolation**: Separation for performance, security, or compliance
    1. **Physical**: Devices are separate and cannot directly communicate unless physically connected. Does not scale well.  
     
    2. **Logical** (VLAN): Separate areas are segmented for different networks, but still housed on the same switch. To connect them you need a layer 3 device, such as a router.  
      
    3. **Virtualization**: The hardware to separate networks is virtualized, including routers, switches, and other devices apart from the infrastructure. Easier to manage from a security standpoint and everything can be segmented.
    4. Air gaps: Network where the devices are physically separate from another and donâ€™t share any components to **communicate**. Great for security but be careful with removable media.
3. **Tunneling/VPN**:
    1. **Site-to-site**: Send data between two sites in an encrypted form. Done by installing a VPN on both sides. Data will reach the VPN and encrypt and then the other VPN will decrypt it for the receiving end.  
   
    2. **Remote access** (Host to Site): Software is installed on the device that wants the VPN tunnel, then the encrypted tunnel is created to connect to the specific network.

    4. **Filters**: Follow the logical path, does not follow a state set of rules for traffic. Blocks harmful traffic.
    5. **Proxies**: Intermediary point between the client and the service. Ensures that the response arrives safely and that the traffic flow is correct.
    6. **Firewalls**: Is state-based so that it can filter by content and more specific perimeters. Placed on the outgoing and inward edges of the network.
    7. **VPN concentrators**: Authenticates VPN clients and establishes between tunnels.
    8. **SSL accelerators**: Offloads the SSL process to a hardware accelerator. SSL handshake is complicated and time consuming.  
     
    9. **Load balancers**: Takes requests from the internet, and spreads the requests over multiple servers, can also determine the health of servers.
    10. **DDoS mitigator**: Sits between the network and the internet. Identifies and blocks DDOS attacks in real time.
    11. **Aggregation switch**: Uplinks to upper layer core switch and links down to the access switch.  

    12. **Taps and port mirror**: Physical tap sees what is happening in traffic packets, and software port mirror sends a copy of the traffic packets. Is better for light traffic.
5. **SDN** (Software Defined Networking): Aims to separate the hardware layer from the control. The network is fully virtualized with software, and then separated into the control (configuration) and data plane (forwarding and firewalling). Directly programmable from a central location, often automatically.
