# Configuration management 

- There are constant changes within the I.T network 

  - operating systems

  - patches

  - application updates

  - network 

  - modifications,  



- Identify and document hardware and software settings 

  - Documentation will be crucial 



# Diagrams 

- Network diagrams 

  - Document the physical wires and device s



- Physical data center layout 

  - Device diagrams; Cables



# Baseline configuration 

- The security of an application environment should be well defined

  - Firewall settings

  - patch levels

  - OS file versions



- Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline

> Baseline configuration of hosts to ensure that config settings match. 



# Standard naming conventions 

- Create a standard

  - Naming needs to be understood by everyone



- Examples of things that need labeling

- Devices 

- Asset tag names

- computer names

- serial numbers

- Networks; Port labeling 

- Domain configurations 



# IP schema 

- An ip address plan or model Consistent addressing for network devices

  - Helps avoid duplicate IP addressing



- Examples of what should be labeled 

  - Locations 

  - number of subnets 

  - hosts per subnet

- IP ranges; different sites have a different subnet 



# Data Protecting 

- A primary job task 

  - an organization is out of business without data



- Data is everywhere 

  - Storage drive 

  - network

  - in a CPU



- Protecting the data 

- Encryption 

- security policies 

- Data permissions



# Data sovereignty

- Data that resides in a country is subject to the laws of that country

  - Laws may prohibit where data is stored. Data collected on EU citizens must be stored in the EU 



# Data masking

- Data obfuscation 

  - hide the original data

  - Protects Personal Identifiable Information (PII) 

  - May only be hidden from view



-**Example** - On a receipt, there is a credit card number with Xs to stop the viewer from seeing the whole number 



# Data encryption

- Encode information into unreadable data



- This causes Confusion 

  - The encrypted data is drastically different than the plaintext 



- **Example** - Having the encryption longer than the text written



# Diffusion 

- Change one character of the input, and many characters change of the output. 

  - One character should change the cipher text



# Data at-rest

- The data is on a storage device 

  - Hard drive, 

  - SSD

  - flash drive



- Encrypt the data; Whole disk encrpytion 

  - Apply permissions 



# Data in-transit

- Data is transmitted in-motion

  - Not much protection as it travels



- Network-based protection; Firewall IPS

  - Provide transport encryption; TLS 



# Data in-use

- Data is actively processing in memory

  - System RAM

  - CPU 



- The data is almost always decrypted 



- The attackers can pick the decrypted information out of RAM



- **Example** Target corp breach. Data was stolen from data in use at POS systems



# Tokenization

- Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder



- **Example** ssn 266-12-1112 but is 691-61-8539



- Common with credit cards processing

  - Replacing number and characters with another set. 

  - .No encryption 



# Information Rights Management (IRM)

- Control how data is used



- Restrict data access to unauthorized persons

  - Prevent copy and paste

  - control screenshots

  - manage to print

  - restrict editing



# Hardware security module (HSM)

- A physical device that is tamper-proof that safeguards secret digital keys. 

  - Used when implementing PKI or SSH to achieve a high degree of data protection



# Geographical considerations

- Legal implications

  - Business regulations vary between states.



- It is important to note that it is important that data is linked to geographical legally. 



- Offsite recovery and offsite back is important,



# Response and recovery controls

- Incident response and recovery 



- Incident response plan should be established

  - Document is critical 



- Limit the impact of an attacker

  - Limit the data exfiltration and limit access to sensitive data 



# SSL/TLS inspection 

- Commonly used to examine outgoing SSL/TLS

  - Transport Layer Security is up to date. 



- SSL inspection relies on trust

  - SSL inspection allows you to be in the middle. 



- A browser doesn't trust a website unless a CA has signed the webserver.



- Validates with DNS record, phone call, etc.



- The browser looks at the web certs to see if it matches then encrypts the information



# Hashing 

- Represent data as a short string of text

  - A message-digest 



- One-way trip

  It- Impossible to recover the original message from the digest.



- Verify a download document that is the same as the original. 

  - You can verify the document on a website.



- Used as a digital signature



- **Example** SHA256 hash, 256 bits / 64 hexadecimal characters. 



# API considerations

- Application Programming Interface



- Secure and harden the login page

  

- On-path attack 

  - Intercept and modify API messages

  - replay API commands

  - Inject data into an API message. 



- DDoS can cause an API to go down.



- WAF, Web Application Firewall 



# Site resiliency

- Recovery site is prepped



- A disaster is called

  - failover to the alternate processing site



- Revert back to the primary location. 



# Hot site

- An exact replica Stocked with hardware, constantly updated



- Applications and software are constantly updated

  - Automated replication 



- Flip a switch and everything moves



# Cold site

- No hardware, empty building. No data

  - No people



# Warm site

- Somewhere between hot and cold.

  - Has racks and some equipment, Hardware is ready and waiting



# Honeypots

- Attract the bad guys, it traps them there



- The attacker is probably a machine; Makes an interesting recon



- Honeypots creates a virtual world

  - Many different options; Kippo, Google Hack Honeypot, Wordpot, etc.



# Honeyfiles and honeynets

- More than one honeypot 



- More than one source of information; Stop spammers'



- Example is passwords.txt; It is a bear trap not real



# Fake telemetry

- Machine learning, interpret big data to identify the invisible



- Train the machine with actual data



- Send the machine learning model with fake telemetry; Make malicious malware look good.



# DNS sinkhole

- A DNS that hands out incorrect IP addresses 

  - This can be bad, an attacker can redirect a user to a malicious site
