# Development to production

- How will you deploy it safely and make it reliable 



- Have a schedule of when the application will be deployed

  - Patch Tuesday, Test and deploy Wednesday, or some set day



- Manage the process, safely move from a non-production phase to full production 



# Sandboxing

- Isolated testing environment   

  - no connection to the real world or production system



- Try some code, Break some code, nobody gets hurt

  - Incremental development 



# Development

- Secure environment 

  - Writing code



- Developers test in their sandboxes



# Test

- Still in the development stage

  - All of the pieces are put together 



# Verifying the application

- There is a QA team or quality Assurance 

  - Verifies features are working as expected 

  - Staging; Almost ready to roll out, more test

  - Working with a copy of production data; Run performance tests



# Using the application

- When the application is live, it is rolled out to the user community

  - A challenging step, impacts users 



- Logistical challenges

  - New servers

  - New software

  - Restart or interrupt service 



# Secure baselines 

- All application instances must follow this baseline

  - Firewall settings

  - patch levels

  - OS file versions



- Find immediate corrections 



# Provisioning 

- The process of deploying an application to the target environment such as an enterprise, desktop, mobile devices, or the cloud 

  - Application software security, operating system 

  - Network security, VLAN, internet access, external access 



# Scalability and elasticity

- Make sure the application can handle application workload

  - Scalability, the ability to increase the workload in a given infrastructure 



- Build an application instance that can handle 100,000 transactions per second



# Orchestration

- Automation is the key to cloud computing, Services appear and disappear automatically 

  - Entire application instances can be instantly provisioned, All servers, networks, switches, firewalls, and policies



# Deprovisioning 

- Dismantling and removing an application instance

  - Security provisioning is important 

  - Firewall policies must be reverted



# Secure coding concepts

- A balance between time and quality

  - Testing, Testing, testing, The QA process



# Stores procedure

- SQL databases

  - Client requests can be complex



- Stored procedures limit the client interactions



- Allows the user to not make any outside database calls



# Obfuscation/camouflage

- Make something normally understandable, very difficult to understand

  - Only helps prevent the search for humans, Scripts can still find the vulnerability 



# Code reuse/dead code

- Code reuse, copy and paste

  - If the old code has security vulnerabilities, reusing the code that spreads to other applications



# Input validation

- What is the expected input, validate actual vs. expected



- Steps to stop unwanted inputs

  - Document all input methods

  - Check and correct all input (normalization)

  - Check and correct all input, A zip code should be only X characters



- Fix any data with improper input

- Using fuzzers will find what you missed



# Validatrion points

- Server-side validation,

  - checks occur on the server

  - Help protect against malicious users



- Client-side validation

  - The end-users app makes the validation decisions 



- Can filter legitimate input from genuine users 



# Memory management

- As a developer, you must be mindful of how memory is used

  - Never trust data input, Malicious user can attempt to circumvent your code



- **Example** - Buffer overflows



# Third-party libraries and SDKs

- Your programming language does everything



- Third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs) 



- There is a security risk, it was written by someone else 



# Data exposure

- So much sensitive data, Credit card numbers, social security numbers, medical information



- Know how the application is handling data, Encryption, and other information

  - All input and output process is important 



# Version Control

- Create a file, make a change, make another change

  - Commonly used in software development 

  - Useful for security



# Exploiting an application

- Attackers often exploit application vulnerabilities

  - Once you exploit one binary, you can exploit them all



# Software diversity

- Alternative computer paths would result in a different binary each time



- An attack against different binaries would only be successful on the traction of the users



# Automation and scripting

- Plan for change, implement automatically



- Automated courses of action, many problems can be predicted

  - Continuous monitoring 

  - Configuration validation 



# Continuous integration

- Code is constantly written

  - Changes for security problems 



- Basic set of security checks during development 

  - Even more security checks



# Continuous delivery/deployment

1. Automate the testing process

2. Automate the release process

3. Click a button and deploy the application

4. Continuous deployment
