# Directory services

- A network service that stores identity information about all the objects in a particular network

  - Keep all of an organizations username and passwords in a single database



- Large distributed database

  - All authentication requests reference this directory

> Browsing obects in an active directory 



# Federation

- A process that provides a shared login capability across multiple systems and enterprises.

  - Provide network access to others, Not just employees, Partners, suppliers, customers, etc. 



= Third parties can establish a federated network, Authenticate and authorize 

  - Third parties must establish a trust relationship 



- **Example** - Log in with Twitter, Log in with Facebook, Log in with Linkedin on websites



# Attestation

- Prove the hardware is really yours, a system you can trust

  - Easy when it's just your computer, 



- Remote attestation, the device provides an operational report to a verification server



- Encrypted and digitally signed with the TPM



- AN IMEI or other unique hardware component can be included in the report 



# Short message service (SMS)

- Text messaging

  - Login factor can be sent via SMS to a predefined phone number



- Input the SMS code into the log in



- Security issue exist, a Phone number can be reassigned, SMS can be intercepted



# Push notification

- Similar process to an SMS notification

  - Usually on a mobile device



- Security challenges

  - Application can be vulnerable



# Authentication Apps

- Carry around a physical hardware token generator, USe software-based token generator on your phone



# TOTP

- TIme-based One-TIme Password Algorithm



- Secret key is configured ahead of time 



- Timestamp usually increments every 30 seconds 



# HOTP 

- HMAC-based One-Time Password algorithm

  - Token-based authentication, The hash is different every time



# Phone call 

- A voice call provides the token

  - the voice will tell you the code 



- phone call be intercepted or forwarded



# Static codes

- Authentication factors that don't change 

  - Personal Identification Number (PIN)



- Can also be alphanumeric, paraphrase



# Smart cards

- Integrated circuit card

  - Common on credit cards but also used on identities 



- Multiple factors, Use the card with a PIN or fingerprint



# Biometric Factors ( Something you are )

- Examples of something you are

  - Fingerprint scanner, Phones. Laptops, door access 

  - Retinal scanner, Unique capillary structure in the back of the eye

  - Iris scanner, Texture, color

  - Voice recognition, Talk for access

  - Facial recognition, the shape of the face, and features 



- Gait analysis 

  - Identify a person based on how they walk 



- Veins 

  - Vascular scanners, Match the surface of the skin



# Biometric acceptance rates

- False acceptance rate (FAR) 

  - Likelihood that an unauthorized user will be accepted, not sensitive enough



- False rejection rate (FRR)

  - Likelihood that an authorized user will be rejected 



- Crossover error rate (CER), 

  - Defines the overall accuracy of a biometric system 



# AAA Framework ( Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting ) 

- Identification 

  - This is who you claim to be, can be your user name 



- Authentication 

  - who you say you are, 

  - Password and other authentication factors



- Authorization

  - based on your identification and authentication 



* Accounting, resource used, Login time, data sent, logout time



# Cloud vs on-premises Authentication

- Cloud-based security, 

  - centralized platoform

  - centralized platform 

  - Automation options with API integration 



- On-premises 

  - authentication system, 

  - Internal moniotring and management



# Factors 

- Something you know

- Something you have

- Something you are 



# Attributes

- Somewhere you are

- Something you can do

- Something you exhibit

- Someone you know 



# Something you know

- It is in your brain, password, 

  - PIN and patterns, Not written down, it is in your brain



# Something you have

- Smart card, integrates with devices. It has a PIN. May require a pin



- USB token, A certificate is on the USB device



- Hardware or software tokens, Generates pseudo-random authentication codes



- Your phone, an SMS you have



# Something you are

- Biometric authentication, fingerprint, iris scan, voice print



- Difficult to change, you cant change your password, Not foolproof



# Somewhere you are

- Provide a factor based on your location 



- IP address, not perfect, but can help provide more info 



- Mobile device location services



# Something you can do 

- A personal way of doing things, Handwriting analysis



- very similar to biometrics, close but not quite



# Someone you know

- A social factor 



- web of trust



- Digital signature
