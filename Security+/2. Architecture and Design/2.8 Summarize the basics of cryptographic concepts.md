# Cryptography 

- In Greek, Crypto means " Hidden, secret "

  - Confidentiality, Its a secret 

  - Authentication and access control



- non-repudiation 

  - you said it, you can't deny it



- Integrity, Tamper-proof



# Plaintext

* Unencrypted message (in the clear)



- Ciphertext

  - An encrypted message



- Cipher

  - The algorithm used to encrypt and or decrypt data



- Cryptanalysis

  - The art of cracking encryption 



# Cryptographic keys

- Keys, The key added to the cipher to decrypt 



# Give weak keys a workout

- A weak key is a weak key

  - Make a weak key stronger by performing multiple processes



- Hash makes the hacker have to guess the password



# Key stretching libraries

- Already built for your application

  - Bcrypt, Generates hashes from passwords



- Password-Based key derivation, RCA keys



# Lightweight cryptography

- Powerful cryptography has traditionally required strength

  - Internet of Things (IoT) devices have limited power 

  - New standards are being created, NIST 



# Homomorphic encryption (HE)

- Method that allows computation of certain fields in a data set without decrypting it

  - Encrypted data is difficult to work with

- Perform calculation of data while it's encrypted



# Symmetric encryption

- A two-way encryption scheme in which encryption and decryption are both performed by the same key.

  - AKA shared-key encryption



- Decrypts with the same key

  -If it gets out, you will need another key

  - Secret key algorithm, a shared secret

  - Symmetric encryption is great, There is one problem. How to transport the key to the right place.

- **Example**  - Two people meet and exchange keys. This key can be used to encrypt any data



# Asymmetric encryption

- Public key and private keys involved



- Public key

  - This key is freely distributed and can be used to perform reverse encryption or decryption on any linked private key pair



- Private key 

  - The private key is known only to the holder and is linked to

  - The private key can be used to encrypt data that can be decrypted by the linked public key.



- If the public key is sniffed, the encryption is still safe.



- Takes a lot of CPU power

# The key pair

- Both keys are built at the same time, The public and Private key

  - Everyone can have the public key while it's not the same for the private



# Elliptic curve cryptography

-Asymmetric encryption, Need large integers composed of two or more large prime factors

 - Use smaller keys than non-ECC asymmetric encryption



- Smaller, Uses curves. This is ideal for IoT devices.

> Example of an Elliptic curve cryptography



# Hash 

- Represent data as a short string of text, A message digest, a fingerprint

  - One-way trip, Impossible to recover the original message from the digest, USed to store passwords / confidentially 



- Verify a downloaded document is the same as the original, Integrity



- Can be a digital signature, Authentication, Non-repudiation, and integrity 



- Will not have a collision



# SHA256 hash

- 256 bits / 64 hexadecimal



# Collision

- Take input of any size, Create a fixed-size string

  - The hash should be unique, different inputs should never create the same hash



- MD5 has a collision problem 



# Practical hashing

- Verify a downloaded file, Hasehs may be provided on the download site, Compare the downloaded file hash with the posted hash value

  - Password storage, Instead of storing the password, store a hash 



# Adding some salt

- Random data added to passwords when hashing

  - Adding randomization to the hashing process, the same password will show up different



-  Rainbow tables will not work with salted hashes



# Digital signatures

- Prove the message has not changed

  - Prove the source of the message, Authentication

  - Make sure the signature isn't fake 

  - Sign with the private key

    - Verify with the public key

# Cryptographic Keys

- There's very little that isn't known

  - The key determines the output, The private key is how people gain access



# Key strength

- Larger keys tend to be more secure



- Symmetric encryption

  - 128-bits or larger symmetric keys are common



- Asymmetric encryption

  - Complex calculation of prime numbers



# Key exchange

- A logistical challenge 

  - Out-of-band key exchange, don't send the symmetric key over the net

  - Telephone, courier, in-person



- Protect the key with additional encryption method



# Real-time encryption/decryption

- There's a need for fast security 

  - Share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption



- Implement session keys carefully 



# Traditional web server encryption

- SSL ( Secure sockets layer) / TLS uses encryption keys to protect the web server

  - This server private key can rebuild everything 



- One point of failure for all of your website encryption



# Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

- A characteristic of transport encryption that ensures if a key is compromised, the compromise will only affect a single person. 

  - Diffie-Hellman ephemeral session key, A single session

# Obfuscation

- The process of making something unclear 

  - It's not impossible to understand 

- Make source code difficult to read



# Steganography

- Greek for "concealed writing" 

  - Message is invisible, The cover text 

  - It could be hidden in a picture



# Common steganography techniques 

- Network-based, Embed messages in TCP packets

  - Use an image to embed the message 

  - Invisible watermarks, Yellow dots on the printer 



- There is also audio steganography 



# Quantum computing

- Computers based on quantum physics, It is a new computing technology

  - Classical mechanics, Uses bits

  - Qubits instead of bits, Not 1 or 0 but in the middle 



- Quantum computers can solve encryption. It is important to keep the encryption updated to fight against this.



# Stream ciphers 

- Encryption is done one bit or byte at a time

  - High speed, Low hardware complexity 



- Used with symmetric encryption 



# Block ciphers

- Encrypt a fixed-length groups

  - 64 bit or 128 bits 



= Uses Symmetric encryption



- Block cipher modes of operation



# ECB ( Electronic Codebook)

- The simplest encryption method

 - Each block is encrypted with the same key

 - ECB encryption without salt



# CBC ( Cipher Block Chaining )

- A popular model for operation



- Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block

  - Uses an initialization vector for the first block

  - The next Ciphertext gets added as the new vector 



# CTR ( Counter )

- Block cipher mode/acts like a stream cipher

  - Encrypts successive values



# GCM ( Galois/Counter mode)

- Encryption with authentication



- Minimum latency



- Commonly used in packetized data

  - SSH, TLS



# Blockchain

- A distributed ledger,

  - Keep track of transactions



- Everyone on the blockchain network maintains the ledger



- Many practical applications

  - Secure voting can be possible

  

# Crpytography Use Cases

  - Encryption data hides the active malware code



- Non-repudiation

  - COnfirm the authenticity of data

  - Digital signature provies integrity.



# Cryptography limitations

- Cryptography isn't the perfect solution 

  - Not all implementations are the same, DIfferent platforms, different cryptographic options



- Cryptography cant fix a bad technique

  - Do your homework



- Speed is an issue

  - A system needs a good CPU

  

- Weak Keys 

  - Larger keys are generally more difficult to brute force 



- Time

  - Encryption and hashing takes time

  

- Key reuse

  - Reusing the same key reduces complexity

  - If things are compromised, That key is at risk
