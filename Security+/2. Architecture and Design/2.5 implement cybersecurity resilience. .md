# Redundancy 

- Duplicate parts of a system, If a part fails, the redundant part can be used

  - Maintain uptime, No software available

  - No system failure 



# Geograpgical Dispersal

- Bad things can happen in a local area; Hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding

  - Disperse technologies to different geographies 

  - Data centers might be part of normal operations



# Disk redundancy

- Multipath I/O (input/output)

  - Multiple drives create redundancy 



- Raid ( Redundant Array of Independent Disks ) 

  - Level 1 - Mirroring means that data is written to two disks simultaneously, providing redundancy (if one disk fails, there is a copy of data on the other). The main drawback is that storage efficiency is only 50%.

  - Level 5 - Striping with parity means that data is written across three or more disks, but additional information (parity) is calculated. This allows the volume to continue if one disk is lost. This solution has better storage efficiency than RAID 1.

  - Level 6 - 	

Double parity, or level 5 with an additional parity stripe, allows the volume to continue when two devices have been lost.



# Load balancing

- Some servers are active, others are on standby 

  - If an active server fails, the passive server takes its place



# NIC teaming

- Load Balancing / failover (LBFO)

  - Aggregate bandwidth, redundant paths 



- multiple network adapters, looks like a single adapter

  - NICs talk to each other, Usually multicast instead of broadcast



# UPS

- Uninterruptible power supply; Short-term backup power 



- Blackouts, brownouts, surges



- UPS types; Offline/standby UPS, Line-interactive UPS, On-line double-conversion UPS



# Generators

- Long-term power backup; Full storage requirement, Power can entire building.

  - It will take a few minutes to get the generator to get up to speed



# Dual power supplies

- Redundancy, Internal power supplies

  - Each power supply can handle 100% of the load 



# Power distribution units (PDUs)

- Provide multiple power outlets, usually in a rack



- Often include monitoring and control 



# SAN replication

- Share data between different devices, if one device fails, you can still work with the data



- Storage area network (SANs), Specialized high-performance network of storage devices



- SAN-to-SAN, duplicate data from one data center to another



- SAN snapshot, Create a state of data based on a point in time



# VM replication

- Virtual machine redundancy, Maintain one VM, replicate to all others

  - Consistent service offering 

  - Recover from a replicated copy 



# On premises vs. cloud redundancy

- Speed, Local devices are connected over a very fast network



- Cloud connection is almost always slower 



- Purchasing your own storage is an expensive capital investment 



- Local data is private, data stored in the cloud requires additional security controls 



# Incremental backup

- A full backup is taken first

  - Subsequent backups contain data changed since the last full backup

# Differential backup

- A full backup is taken first

  - Subsequent backups contain data changed since the last full backup

# Backup media

- Magnetic tape, 100 GB to multiple terabytes per cartridge.



- Disk, faster than magnetic tape, Deduplicate and compress



- Copy, a useful strategy, may not include versioning 



# NAS vs. SAN

- Network Attached Storage

  - file-level access



- Storage Area Network

  - Looks and feels like local storage 



# Cloud 

- Backup to a remote device in the cloud

  - support many devices, may be limited by bandwidth



- Capture an exact replica of everything on a storage drive 



- Restore everything on a partition



# Offline backup

- Backup to local devices 

  - Fast and secure



# Online backup

- Remote network connected 



- Encrypted 



# Non-persistence

- The cloud is always in motion, Applications instances are built and torn down



- Snapshots can capture the current configuration and data 



- Revert to a known state 



- Rollback to known configuration, Don't modify the data but use a previous configuration 



- Live boot media.



# High availability 

- Redundancy doesn't always mean available



- High availability is always on, multiple components working together.



- Active/Active can provide scalability advantages



- Higher availability almost always means higher cost



# Order of restoration

- Application-specific, certain components may need to be restored first



- Databases should be restored before the application



# Diversity

- A zero-day OS vulnerability can cause significant outages



- Multiple security devices, A fire, and an IPS



- Vendors, a single vendor can become a disadvantage, multiple are recommended 



- Cryptographic, All cryptography is temporary, Diverse certificate authorities can provide additional protection



- Controls, Administrative controls, Physical controls, Technical controls, Combine them together
