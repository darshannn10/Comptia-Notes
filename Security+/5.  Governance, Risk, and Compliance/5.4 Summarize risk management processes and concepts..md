# Risk assessment 

- Identify assets that could be affected by an attack

- Identify threats  

  - Loss of data, disruption of services, etc.

  - Determine the risk

    - High, medium, or low risk

- Assess the total risk to the organization 



# RIsk assessments

- External threats 

  - Outside the organization

  - Hacker groups, Former employees

- Internal threats

  - Employees and partners 

  - Disgruntled employees

- Legacy system

  - Outdated, older technologies

  - May bot be supported by the manufacturer

  - May does not have security patches

# Multi-party risk

- Breaches involving multiple parties

  - Often trusted business relationships

- May 2019 - American medical collection agency 

  - Data breach disclosed personal information on 24 million individuals 

# Risk assessments

- Intellectual property (IP) theft

  - Theft of ideas, inventions, and creative expressions 

  - Human error, hacking, employees with access

  - Identify and protect IP

- Software compliance/licensing

  - Operational risk with too few licenses 

  - Financial risk with budgeting 

# Risk management strategies 

- Acceptance 

  - A business decision

- Risk-avoidance 

  - Stop participating in a high-risk activity 

- Transference

  - Buy some cybersecurity insurance 

- Mitigation

  - Decrease the risk with software 

  

# Evaluating risk

- Risk register

  - Every ptoject has a plan, but also has risk

  - Identify and document the risk associated with each step 

- Risk matrix heat map 

	- View the results of the risk assessment

	- Visually identify risk based on color

	- Assists with making strategic decisions

# Audit risk model

- Inherent risk

  - impact + likelihood

- Residual risk

  - Inherent risk + control effectiveness 

- Risk appetite 

  - The amount of risk an organization is willing to take 



# Risk control assessment

- Risk has been determined

- Time to build cybersecurity requirements

- Find the gap

  - Often requires a formal audit

- Build and maintain security systems based on the requirements

- Determine if existing controls are compliant or non-compliant 



# Risk awareness

- A constantly changing battlefield 

  - New risks, emerging risks

- Knowledge is key

  - Part of every employee's daily job role

- Maintaining awareness

  - Ongoing group discussions

  - Presentation from law enforcement 

# Regulations that affect risk posture 

- Regulations directly associated with cybersecurity

  - Protection of personal information, disclosure of information breaches

  - Requires a minimum level of information security 

- HIPPA 

  - Health insurance portability and accountability act

  - NEw storage requirements

- GDPR

   - General data protection regulation

  

 # Qualitative risk assessment

  - Identify significant risk factors 

    - Ask opinions about the significance

    - Display visually with traffic light grid or similar method 

- Likelihood

  - Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

 

 # Quantitative risk assessment

 - SLE

   - Single loss expectancy

  - ALE 

    - Annualized loss expectancy 

  - The business impact can be more than monetary 





# Disaster types

- Environment threats

  - Tornado, hurricane, earthquake

- Person-made threats

- Internal and external threats 



# Recovery

- Recovery time objective (RTO)

  - Get up and running quickly

- Recovery point objective (RPO)

  - How much data loss is acceptable

- Meantime to repair MTTR)

  - Time required to fix the issue

- Meantime between failures (MTBF)

  - Predict the time between outages



# Functional recovery plans

- Recover from an outage

  - Step-by-step guide

- Contact information

  - Someone is on call

- Technical process

  - Reference the knowledge base 

  - Recover and test 



# Removing single points of failure

- A single event can ruin your day 

  - Unless you make some plans

- Network configuration

  - Multiple devices

- Facility/utilities 

- People/Location

- There's no practical way to remove all points of failure 



# Disaster recovery plan (DRP)

- Detailed plan for resuming operations after a disaster

  - Application. data center, building

- Extensive planning prior to the disaster

  - BAckups

  - Off-site replication

  - cloud alternatives

- Many third-party options

  - Physical location

  - Recovery services



# Impact

- Life

  - The most important consideration

- Property 

  - The risk to buildings and assets

- Safety 

  - some environments are dangerous

- Finance

- Reputation 



# Mission-essential functions

- If a hurricane blew through, what functions would be essential to the organization



- What computing systems are required for these mission-essential function 



# Site risk assessment

- All locations is a bit different 



- Recovery plans should consider unique environments
