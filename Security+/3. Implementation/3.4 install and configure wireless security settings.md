# Securing a wireless network

- An organization wireless network can contain confidential information



- Authenticate the users before granting access

  - Who gets access to the wireless network



- Ensure all communication is confidential



# Wireless encryption

- All wireless computers are radio transmitters and receivers 

  - Anyone can listen

  - Encrypting the data will be the solution



# WiFi protected access (WPA2)

- CCMP block cipher block chaining 

  - Created in 2004

  - CCMP security servies (AES protocol)



- Has a brute-force problem

  - PSK brute-force problem

 

# WPA 3

- GCMP block cipher mode

  - Galois/Counter mode protocol

  - A stronger envryption than WPA2

  - GCMP security services



# Simultaneous Authentication (SAE)

- WPA3 uses PSK authentication process

  - Includes mutual authentication

  - Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network

  - No hashes, no brute force attacks



- In SAE, everyone uses a different session key



# Wireless authentication methods

- Shared password / pre-shared key (PSK)

  - Personal 

  - WPA3 - PSK

- Centralized authentication (802.1X)

  - Enterpise 

  - WPA3- Enterpise (802.1X)



# Captive portal

- Authentication to a network

  - Common on wireless networks



- Access table recognizes a lack of authentication

  - Username / password ex: Hotel 



# Using WPS

- Wi-Fi Protected Setup

- Used to be called Wi-Fi Simple Config



- Allows "easy" setup of a mobile device



# The WPS hack

- WPS has a design flaw

  - PIN is an eight-digit number, only 10,000,000 combinations

  - Easy to hack 



# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

- EAP integrates with 802.1X

  - Prevents access to the network



# IEEE 802.1X

- Port-based Network Access Control

  - USed in conjunction with an access database



- Three different parts

- Supplicant, Authenticator, the Authentication server



# EAP-FAST

- EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling

 

# PEAP

- Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol

  - Uses EAP in TLS tunnel



- User autneticatites with MSCHAPv2



# EAP-TTLS

- EAP Tunneled Transport Layer Security

- Requires a digital certificate



# Radius Federation

- Members of one organization can authenticate

  - Uses 802.1x as the authentication method



# Site survey

- Determine existing wireless landscape

  - Sample the existing wireless spectrum

  - IDentify existing access points 

  - Workaround existing frequencies

  - Plan for an ongoing site survey



# Wireless packet analysis

- Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor

  - You have to be quiet, You cant hear the network if you are busy transmitting

  - Some network drivers won't capture wireless information

  - View wireless-specific information



# Access point placement

- Minimal overlap

- Avoid interference
