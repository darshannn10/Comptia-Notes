# Public Key Infrastructure

- Policies, procedure, hardware, software, people 

  - Digital certiciates



- This is a big,big,endeavor 



- Also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices 



# The key management lifecycle 

- Key generation 

  - create a key with the requested strength



- Cerificate generation



- Distribution 

  - Make the key available to the user



- Storage 

  - Securely store and protext against unauthorized use 



- Revocation 

  - Manage keys that have been compromised 



# Digital certificates

- A public key certificate

  - Binds a public key with a digital signature 



- A digital signature adds trust 

  - PKI uses Certificate Authority 



- Certificate creation can be built into the OS



# Commerical certificate authorities 

- Built-in to your browswer



- Purchase your web site certificate



- Create a key pair, send the public key to the CA to be signed



- May provide different levels of trust and additional features 



# Private certificate authorities

- You are your own CA 

  - Built in CA



- Needed for medium-to-large organization 



# PKI trsut relationships

- Single CA 

  - Everyone recieves their certificates 



- Hierarchial 



# Registration authority (RA)

- The entity requesting the certificate needs to be verified 



- Approval or rejection 

  - The foundation of trust in this model



- Responsible for revocations 



- Manage renewals and re-key requests

# Common Name (CN)

- The FQDN ( Fully qualified domain name) For the certificate

- There is 398 day browser limit



# Key revocation

- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

  - Maintained by certificate Authority 

  - Changes all the time 



- Example: CVE-2014-0160 

  - OpenSSL was patched and every web server certificate was replaced 

# Getiing revocation details to the browser

- OCSP ( Online Certificate Status Protocol)

  - The browser can check certificate revocation



- Not all browsers/apps support OCSP 



# Web server SSL certificate

- Domain validation certificate (DV)

  - Owner of the certificate has some control over a DNS domain 



- Extended validation certificate (EV)

  - Additional checks have verified the certificate owner's identity. 



- Subject alternative name (SAN)

  - Extension to an X.509 certificate 

  - Lists additional identification information 

  

- Wildcard domain

  - Certificates bason on the name of the server 

  - * means all server names in a domain 



# Code signing certificate

- Developers can provide a level of trust 

  - Applications can be signed by the developer



- The user's operating system will examine the signature 



# Root certificate

- The public key certificate that identifies the root CA ( Certificate Authority)

- THe root certificate issues other certificates 



# Self-signed certificates 

- Internal certificates don't need to be signed by a public CA 

  - Your company is the only one going to use it



- Build your own CA 



# Machine and computer certificates 

- You have to manage many devices



- Other business processes rely on the certificate 



# Email certificate

- Use cryptography in an email platform



- Encrypting emails 

  - Use  a recipient public key 



- Receiving encrypted emails 

  - Use your private key to decrypt 



# User certificate

- Associate a certificate with a user 

  - A powerful electronic ID card 



# Certificate file formats 

- X.509 digital certificates 

  - The structure of the certification is standardized



- There are many certificate file formats 

  - You can convert different formats



# DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)

- Format designed to transfer syntax for data structures 



- Used for JAVA



# PEM ( Privacy-Enhanced Mail)

- ASCII format 

  - Letters and numbers 

  - Easy to email 

  - Readable 



# PKCS #12

- Public Key Cryptography Standards #12



- Personal Informational Exchange Syntax Standard 



# CER (Certificate)

- Primarily a Windows X.509 File extension 



- Contains a public key 



- COmmon format for Windows certificates 



# # PKCS #12

- Public Key Cryptography Standards #7



- Cryptographic message syntax 



# Online and Offline CAs

- A compromised certificate authority 

 - No certificates issued by that CA can be trusted



- Distribute the load 

  - Take the CA offline and protect it 



# OCSP stapling

- Online certificate status protocol  

  - Provides scalability for OCSP checks



- The CA is responsible for responding to all client OCSP requests 



- Instead, Have certificate holders verify their own status 



# Pinning

- You are communicating over TLS/SSL to a server 



- Pin the expected certificate or public key to an application



# PKI trust relationships

- Single CA 

  - Everyone recieves their certificates from on authority 



- Hierarchical

  - SIngle CA ussues certs to intermediate CAs



- Mesh

  - Cross-certifying CAs

 

 - Web of trust

# Key escrow 

- Someone else holds your decryption keys 

  - A third party has it 



- Need clear process and procedures 

  - You must be able to trust your 3rd-party keys 



# Certificate chaining

- Chain of trust

  - List all of the certs between the server and root CA 



- The chain starts with the SSL certificate 



- The web server needs to be configured with the proper chain
