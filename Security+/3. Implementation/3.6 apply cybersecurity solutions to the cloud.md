# HA across zones

- Availability zones

  - Isolated locations within a cloud region

  - AZ commonly spans across multiple regions



- Build applications to be highly available (HA)

  - Run as active/standby or active/active 



- Use load balancers to provides seamless HA



# Resource policies

- Identity and access management (IAM)

  - Who gets access 

  - What they get access to



- Map job functions to roles 

  - COmbine users into groups



- Provide access to cloud resources 



- Centralize user accounts 



# Secrets management

- API keys, passwords, certificates 

- This can quickly become overwhelming which is difficult to manage



- Authorize access to the secrets 

  - Limit access to the secrets 



# Integration and auditing

- Integrate security across multiple platforms 



- Consolidate log storage and reporting

  - Cloud-Based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)



- Auditing

  - Validate security controls



# Cloud storage

- Data in on a public cloud

  - is not public data



- Access can be limited

  - and protected



- Data may be required in different geographical locations

  - A backup is always required



- Availability is always important



# Permissions

- A significant cloud storage concern

  - One permission mistake can cause a data break



- Public access

  - Should not usually be the default



- Identity and Access Management (IAM)

 - Bucket policies

 - Globally blocking public access

 - Don't put data in the cloud unless it needs to be there 



# Encryption

- Cloud data is more accessible than non-cloud data

- Server-side encryption

  - Encrypt the data in the cloud

  - Data is encrypted when stored on disk 



- Client-side encryption 

  - Data is already encrypted when it's sent to the cloud

  - Performed by the applications



# Replication

- Copy data from one place to another

  - Disaster recovery, high availability 



- Data analysis

  - Analytics big data analysis



- Backups; COnstant duplication of data 



# Cloud networks

- Connect cloud components 

  - Users communicate to the cloud

  - Over a VPN tunnel



- Cloud devices communicate with each other 



# Virtual networks

- A cloud contains virtual devices



- virtual switches, virtual routers 



# Public and private subnets

- Private cloud

  - All internal IP addresses

  - Connect to the private cloud over a VPN



- Public cloud

  - External IP addresses

  - Connect to the cloud from anywhere



- Hybrid cloud

  - Combine internal cloud resources with external 



# Segmentation

- The cloud contains separate VPCs, Containers, and microservices



- Separation is a security opportunity



- Add security systems between application components 



# API inspection and integration

- Microservice architecture is the underlying application change



- API calls can include risk

  - API monitoring 



# Compute cloud instances

- The IaaS component for the cloud computing environment

  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

  - Google Compute Engine (GCE)

  - Microsoft Azure VM 

- Manage computing resources



# Security groups

- A firewall for compute instances

- Layer 4 port number 

  - TCP or UDP 



- Layer 3 address

  - Individual addresses

  - CIDR block notation



# Dynamic resource allocation 

- Provision resources when they are needed

  - Based on demand

  - Provisioned automatically 



- Scale-up and down

  - Allocate compute resources 

  - Rapid elasticity 



# Instance awareness

- Granular security controls

- Define and set policies 



# Virtual private cloud endpoint

- VPC gateway endpoints

  - Allow private cloud subnets

  - Keep private resources private

 

# Container Security 

- Containers have singular security concerns as any other application deployment method



- Use container-specific operating systems 

  - A minimalist OS designed for containers



- Group container types on the same host 



# Cloud access security Broker (CASB)

- Clients are at work, data is in the cloud 



- How do you make your security policies work in the cloud?



- CASB works of multiple characteristics 

  - Visibility

  - Compliance

  - Threat prevention

  - Data security



# Application security

- Secure cloud-based applications

  - Complexity increases in the cloud



- Application misconfigurations

  - One of the most common security issues



- Authorization and access

  - Control should be strong



# Next-Gen Secure Web Gateway (SWG)

- Protect users and devices 

  - Regardless of location and activity



- Go beyond URLs and GET request

  - Examine application API 



- Examine JSON strings and API request 



- Instance - aware security



# Firewalls in the cloud

- Control traffic flows in the cloud 

  - Inside the cloud and external 



- Cost

  - Relatively inexpensive compared to appliances 



- Segmentation 

  - Between microservices, VMs, or VPCs 

  

# Security controls

- Integrated and supported by the cloud provider

- Many configurations options



- Third-party solutions

  - Support across multiple cloud providers 

  - Single pane of glass

  - More extensive reporting
