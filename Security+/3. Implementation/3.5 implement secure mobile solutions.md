# Biometrics

- You are the authentication factor



- May not be the most secure 

  - Useful in some environments



- Availability is managed through MDM

  - Organization determines the security of the device



- Can be managed per-app

  - Some apps require additional biometric authentication



# Context-aware authentication

- Authentication can be contextual



- Combines multiple contexts

  - IP address

  - GPS information

  - Bluetooth



# Containerization

- Difficult to separate personal from business

  - Especially when the device is BYOD



- Separate enterprise and mobile apps



- Full device encryption

# MicroSD HSM

- Shrink the PCI Express Hardware Security Module

  - Now in a microSD card



- Provides security services

  - Encryption



# Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)

- Manage mobile and non-mobile devices

  - An evolution of MDM



- End-users have different types of devices.

  - Their use has blended together



- All of these devices can be used from anywhere 



# Mobile Application Management (MAM)

- Provision, update and remove apps

  - Keep everyone running at the correct version



- Create an enterprise app catalog

  - Users can choose and install apps they need



- Monitor application use



# SEAndroid

- Gaining access

  - Android - rooting

  - apple IOS - Jailbreaking



- Install customer firmware 



# Carrier unlocking

- Most phones are locked to a carrier 



# Firmware OTA updates

- The operating system of a mobile device is constantly changing

  - Similar to a desktop computer
