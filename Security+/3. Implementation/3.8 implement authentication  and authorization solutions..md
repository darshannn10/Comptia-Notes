# Password keys

- Hardware-based authentication

  - Something you have

  

- Help prevent unauthorized logins and account take over 



- Doesn't replace other factors

  - Passwords are still important



# Password vaults

- Password managers 

  - All passwords are in one password

  - A database of credentials 



- Secure storage 

  - All credentials are encrypted 



- Create unique passwords

  - Passwords are not the same across sites 



# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

- A specification for cryptographic functions 

  - HArdware to help with all of the encryption 



- Cryptographic processor 

  - Random number generator 



- Persistent memory 

  - Comes with unique keys burned in during production 



- Versatile memory 

  - Password protected 



# Hardware security module (HSM)

- High-end cryptographic hardware 

  - Plug-in card or separate hardware devices 

- Key backup

  - Secured storage



- Cryptographic accelerators 



- Used in large environments 



# Knowledge-based authentication (KBA)

- Use personal knowledge as an authentication factor 

  - Something you know 



- Static KBA

  - Pre-configured shared secrets 

  - Often used with account recovery 

  - Example: what was the make and model of the first car?



- Dynamic KBA 



# Gaining access 

- An outside user tries to gain access to a firewall/VPN concentrator

  - The VPN and firewall sends information to the AAA server to see if it is valid

  - It is then sent on to the file server



# PAP 

- Password Authentication Protocol)

- A basic authentication method 

  - used in legacy operating systems



- PAP is in the clear 

  - Non-encrypted password exchange 



# CHAP

- Challenge-Handshake authentication protocol 

  - Encrypted challenge sent over the network



- Three-way hand shale 

  - Server compares receives hash 



# MS-CHAP 

- Microsoft implementation of CHAP 



- Used DES

  - Easy to brute force 

  - Do not use this

  - we use L2TP, IPSEC, 802.1X 



# RADIUS

- ( Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)

- One of the more common AAA protocols 



- Centralize authentication for users 



# TACACS

- Terminal access Controller Access-control system

  - Remote authentication protocol 



- XTACACS 



- TACACS+ 



# Kerberos 

- Network authentication protocol 

 - Authenticate once, Trusted by the system 

 - No need to re-authenticate everything 



- Microsoft started in 2000



# SSO with Kerberos

- Authenticate one time 

  - Lots of backend ticketing

  - Cryptographic tickets 



- No constant username and password input

  - only works with Kerberos 



- There are other SSO methods



# RADIUS, TACACS+. KERBEROS

- Three different ways to communicate to an authentication server 



- Often determined by what is at hand 

  - VPN concentrator can talk to a RADIUS server 



- TACACS+ 

  - A Cisco device 



- KERBEROS 

  - Windows



# IEEE 802.1x

- Port-based Network Access control (NAC)



- EAP integrated with 802.1X 



- Used in conjunction with an access database 



# Federation

- Provide network access to others 

  - Not just employees - Partners, suppliers, customers. etc.



- Third-parties can establish a federated network 



- Third-party must establish a trust 



# Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

- Open standard for authentication and authorization 



- You can authenticate through a third party to gain access 



- Not originally designed for mobile apps 



# The SAML authentication flow

- Resource server, Client browser, the authorization server 



# OAuth

- Authorization Framework 

  - Determines what resources a user will be able to access 



- Created by Twitter, Google, and many others 



- Not an authentication protocol 

  - Allows what another app can do



# Access control

- Authorization 

  - The process of ensuring only authorized rights are exercised 



- The process of determining rights 

  - Policy definition 



# Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

- The operating system limits the operation of an object 



- Every object gets a label

  - Confidential, secret, top-secret, etc. 



- Labeling of objects uses predefined rules. 



# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

- Used in most operating systems 

  - A familiar access control model 



- You create a spreadsheet

  - As the owner you control who has access 



# Role-based access control (RBAC)

- You have a role in your organization 

 - Manager, director, team lead, project manager 



- Administrators provide access based on the role of the user 



# Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

- Users can have complex relationships to applications and data 



- ABAC can consider many parameters 



- Combine and evaluate multiple parameters 



# Rule-based access control 

- Generic term for following rules 

  - Conditions other than who you are



- Access is determined through system-enforced rules 



- The rule is associated with that object 



- Example: Only can access at certain parts of the day 



# File system security 

- store files and access them 



- Encryption can be built-in. 



# conditional access 

- Difficult to apply old methods of authentication to new methods of working 



- Conditions

  - Employee or partner location 



- Controls 

  - Allow or block, require MFA, provide limited access 



- Administrators can build complex access rules 



# Privileged access management (PAM)

- Managing superuser access 

  - Administrator and root 

  - You don't want to use this in the wrong hands 



- Store privileged account in a digital vault 



- PAM advantages 

- Centralized password management 

  - Enables automation 

  - Manage access for each user
