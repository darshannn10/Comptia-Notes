# Load balancing 

- A type of switch or router that distributes client requests between different resources, such as communications links or similarly configured servers. This provides fault tolerance and improves throughput.



- Active/Passive

  - If a server gets shut down, it can relay information to another one



# Scheduling

- The scheduling algorithm is the code and metrics that determine which node is selected for processing each incoming request.

  - Robin, Which is picking up the next node

  - Another method is picking up the node with the least load



# Persistance 

- In load balancing, the configuration option enables a client to maintain a connection with a load-balanced server over the duration of the session. Also referred to as sticky sessions.

  - Works by setting a cookie

  - The browser has to accept the cookie



# Network Segmentation

- A portion of a network where all attached hosts can communicate freely with one another 



# Intranet (a private network)

- A private network that is only accessible by the organizations own personal

  - a network of trusted hosts owned and controlled by the organization. 



# Extranet

- A network of semi-trusted hosts, typically business partners, suppliers, or customers



# Virtual local area network (VLAN)

- Logically separate network, created by using switching tech. Even though hots on two VLANs may be physically connected to the same cabling, local traffic is isolated to each VLAN

# demilitarized zones (DMZ)

- A segment isolated from the rest of a private network by one or more firewalls that accepts connection from the internet over designated ports

  - perimeter or edge network.



# East-West Traffic

- Design paradigm accounting for the fact that data center traffic between servers is greater than that passing in and out 



# Zero Trust

- Security design paradigm where any request must be authenticated before being allowed.

  - Continuous authentication and conditional access to mitigate privilege escalation and compromise by threat actors.



# Virtual private network

- A secure tunnel created between two endpoints connected via an unsecured network

  - Clients connect to a VPN gateway on a private network

# Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

- VPN protocol for tunneling PPP sessions across a variety of network protocols such as IP, Frame Relay, or ATM

  1. The client and VPN gateway set up a secure IPSec channel over the Internet, using either a pre-shared key or certificates for IKE.

  2. The VPN gateway uses L2TP to set up a tunnel to exchange local network data encapsulated as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames. This double encapsulation of traffic is the main drawback, as it adds overhead.

  3. The user authenticates over the PPP session using EAP or CHAP.



# Always on VPN

- Always-on VPN means that the computer establishes the VPN whenever an internet connection over a trusted network is detected, using the server cached credentials to authenticate. 



# Split tunnel 

- VPN configuration where only traffic for the private network is routed via the VPN gateway

# Full tunnel 

- VPN configuration where all traffic is routed via the VPN gateway

  - Better security, the address translates to DNS operations

  - This is used to communicate between VPN gateways across an unsecured network.



# Network access control (NAC)

- Agents

  - Software and hardware agents

  - Deep inspection, not just of packets, but of the entire endpoint



# MAC filtering 

- Apply an access control list to a switch or access point so that only clients with approved MAC addresses can connect to it

  - Having a list of hardware that can connect to a port



# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping 

- A configuration option that enables a switch to inspect a DHCP traffic to prevent MAC spoofing

  - inspects traffic arriving on access ports 



# Broadcast Storm Prevention

- Traffic that is recirculated and amplified by loops in a switching topology, causing network slowdowns and crashing switches 



# Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) guard 

- Switch port security feature that disables the port if it receives BPDU notifications related to spanning tree. 



# Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- Spanning tree is means for the bridges to organize themselves into a hierarchy and prevent loops from forming. 



# Domain name resolution
