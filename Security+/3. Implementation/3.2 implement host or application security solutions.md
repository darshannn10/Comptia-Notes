# Antivirus

-  Software that is characterized by signature-based detection and prevention of the known viruses.

   - On access antivirus scanner or intrusion prevention system works by identifying when processes or scripts are executed and intercepted. 



# Anti-malware

- Malware detection, Versus, Worms, Trojans, Spyware, PUPs, Cryptojackers

  - It captures signatures but unfortunately it is not consistent



# Endpoint detection and response (EDR)

- Configure the management system to push the hasn't software and updates 

  - Assign hosts to appropriate groups for policy assignment; Isolate a client when a threat is detected

  - Test the different host groups configuration setting to ensure that the expected range of threats are detected

  - Use a monitoring dashboard to verify status across all network hosts.



# Data Loss Prevention

- Many Endpoint Protection Platforms have a Data Loss Prevention agent

  - There are configured policies to identify privileged files and strings that should be kept private or confidential 

  - The agent enforces the policy to prevent data from being copied or attached to a message without authorization



# Next-generation firewall (NGFW) 

- Host or network firewall capable of parsing application layer protocol header and data 

  - Product combined application-aware filtering with user account-based filtering and the ability to act as an intrusion prevention system



# Host-Based Intrusion Detection (HIDS) / Host-Based Intrusion Prevention (HIPS)

- Host-based intrusion detection systems provide threat detection via log and file system monitoring 

  - HIDS come in many different forms with different capabilities 



- HIPS

  - File system integrity monitoring uses signatures and monitor ports



# Host-based firewall

- A software application running on a single host and designed to protect that host

  - Implemented as a software application running on a single host designed to protect that host only.

  - Also enforcing packet filtering ACLs, a personal firewall 



# Unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI)

- A system firmware providing support for 64-bit CPU operation at boot, full GUI, and mouse operation 

  - Provides code that allows the host to boot to an OS



# Measured boot

- A UEFI feature that gathers secure metrics to validate the boot process in an attestation report

  - Checks whether hashes of key streams state data ( Boot firmware, Boot loader, OS kernel, etc.

 

 # Boot attestation

 - Report of boot state integrity data that is signed by a tamper-proof TPM key and is reported to a network server

   - The boot log can be analyzed for signs of compromise, such as the presence of unsigned drivers.

> Secure boot settings in UEFI



# Tokenization

- Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder

  - Example - SSN 266-12-1112 which is now 691-61-8539

  - This is not encryption or hashing 



# Hashing a password

- Hashes represent data as a fixed-length string of text

  - A message digest, or "fingerprint"

  - A common way to store passwords



# Adding some salt

- Random data added to a password when hashing

  - Every yser gets their own random salt 

  - Stops rainbow tables with hashes

  - Slows down brute force attacks 



# Secure cookies

- Cookies are a vector for session hijacking and data exposure if not configured correctly

  - Some key parameters for the set cookies are

  1. Avoid using persistent cookies for session authentication

  2. Set the Secure attribute to make the cookies inaccessible to document object/model/client-side scripting

  3. USe the SameSite attribute to control where a cookie may be sent 



# HTTP Headers

- A number of security options can be set in response to the header returned by the server. 

  - Developers are constrained by compatibility and implementation between different client browser and server software types.

  - Options to help with security are

  1. HTTP Strict Transport Security - Forces browser to connect using HTTPS only

  2. COntent Security Policy - mitigates clickjacking, script injection, etc

  3. Cache-control - Sets whether the browser can cache responses



# Input validations

- Any technique used to ensure that the data entered into a field or variable in an application is handled appropriately by that application

  - SQL injections 

  - To prevent this, all input methods should be tested and documented



# Code Signing

- The principal means of proving the authenticity and integrity of code ( Executable or a script )

  - The developer creates a cryptographic hash or files that signs the hash using the private key. 



# Manual code review

- The process of peer review of uncompiled source code by other developers 

  - Identify oversights, mistaken assumptions, or a lack of knowledge or experience.



# Dynamic code analysis

- The application is tested under real-world conditions by using a staging environment 

  - Example: exposure to race conditions or unexpected user input



# Fuzzing

- A dynamic code analysis technique that involves sending a running application random and unusual input so as to evaluate how the app responds. 

  - Means of testing an application in which input validation routines work well

  - input and records responses made by the applications

# Hardening

- The process of making a host or app configuration secure by reducing its attack surface, through running only necessary services

  - Installing monitoring software to protect against malware and intrusions

  - Establishing a maintenance schedule to ensure the system is patched to be secure



# Open port and services

- Open port allows client software to connect to the application over a network

  - These should be disabled or blocked at a firewall if remote access is not required



# Registry

- The primary configuration data for Windows

- Useful to know what an application modifies 

   - Some registry changes are important

> What the Windows Registry Editor looks like 



# Disk encryption

- Prevent access to application data files 

  - File system encryption



# Full disk encryption (FDE)

- Encrypt everything on the drive 

  - Bitlocker is an example, It comes with windows 



# Self-encrypting drive (SED)

- Hardware-based full disk encryption

  - No operating system software needed

 

- Opal storage specification

  - The standard 



# Operating system hardening

- Many and varied 

  - Windows, Linux, iOS, Android



- Updates 

  - Operating systems 

  - User accounts; Good passwords

  - Limited access and security; Limit network access



- Monitor and secure

  - Anti-virus, anti-malware



# Patch management

- Incredibly important

- Monthly updates ( Incremental )

- Third-party updates, Application developers



# Sandboxing

- Application cannot access unrelated resources 



- Commonly used during development

  - USed in many different deployments 



# Hardware Root of Trust (RoT)

- A cryptographic module embedded within a computer system that can be endorse and trusted in the boot settings

  - Submit a report to the network access control 



# Trusted platform module (TPM)

- A specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, kets, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification

  - TPM is implemented as part of the chipset or embedded in the CPU
