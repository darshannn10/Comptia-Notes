# Domain Name System

- The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves fully qualified domain names to IP addresses.

  - Uses a distributed database system that contains information on the domains and hosts within those domains

  

- dnschef in Kali Linux allows you to create a fake domain. 

  - Using Metasploit, you can create your own DHCP server.

  

# DNS Secrutiy Extensions (DNSSEC)

- A security protocol that provides authentication of DNS data and uploads DNS data integrity. 

  - To mitigate against spoofing and poisoning attacks, there is a process for DNS responses.

  

 - DNSSEC has a package of resource records signed with a private key.

   - When the server records an exchange, the authoritative server records the exchange.

   

# SSH ( Secure Shell ) 

- A remote administration and file-copy program that supports VPNs by using port forwarding that runs on port 22

  - The main use for SSH is secure file transfer (SFTP)

  - The most used is [openssh](openssh.com)

  

 - SSH servers are identified by a public/private key pair (asymmetrical) 

   - Kerberos

  

# Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)

- An email encryption standard that adds digital signatures and public-key cryptography to traditional MIME communications

  - The user is issued a digital certificate containing his or her public key.

  - Between user interaction, both of them have each other's keys. Public and private keys.



# Secure Real-time Protocol (SRTP)

- Version of RTP using TLS

  - A master key used to secure versions (AES)

  

 - Voice and video over IP

  - Authentication, integrity, and replay protection



# Lightweight Directory Access (LDAP)

- A network protocol used to access network directory databases, Which store information about authorized users and their privileges

  - Runs on port 389

  - No security and all transmissions are in plaintext

  - Vulnerable to sniffing and man-in-the-middle-attacks



# LDAP secure

- A network protocol used to access network directory databases, which store information about the authorized user and their privileges

  - The server is installed with a digital certificate which is used to secure the tunnel for the user credential exchange. 



# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

- A protocol used to transfer files between network hosts.

  - Configured with several public directories



# File Transfer Protocol, Secure (FTPS)

- A type of FTP using TLS for confidentiality 



# SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)

- A secure version of the File Transfer Protocol that uses SSH

  - Uses FTP to encrypt the authentication and data transfer between client and server



# Simple Network Management Protocol Security

- Protocol for monitoring and managing network devices.

  - Widely used framework for management and monitoring

  - Runs on a switch, router, server, or other SNMP-compatible network devices



# Protocol, version 3 (SNMPv3)

- Standard based protocol that is defined in RFC 3413 to 3415

  - Message integrity

  - Authentication

  - encryption



# Hypertext transfer protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS)

- The protocol used to provide web content to browsers. HTTP uses port 80. HTTPS provides encrypted transfers using port 443.

  - A clients connection to HTTP is using the correct TCP port



- IPsec

  - Internet Protocol Security is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network



- Transport mode

  - This mode is used to secure communications between hosts on a private network.

- Tunnel mode

  - This mode is used for communications between VPN gateways across an unsecured network creating a VPN

- ESP

  - Whole IP packet is encrypted and encapsulated as a datagram with a new IP header



# Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3)

 - TCP port 110 enables a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server

 - The server deletes messages once the client has downloaded them



# Internet Message Access Orticik v4 (IMAP4)

  - TCP/IP application protocol providing a means for a client to access and manage email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server

    - supports permanent connections to a server over port 143
