# Identity provider (Idp)

- Who are you?

  - A service needs to vouch for you 

  - Authentication as a service



- A list of entities 

  - Users and devices



- Commonly used by SSO applications

  - Cloud-based services need to know who you are 



# Attribures

- An identifier or property of an entity 

  - provides identification



- Personal attributes 

  - One or more attributes can be used for the identification 



# Certificates

- Digital certificate

  - Assigned to a person or device



- Binds the identity of the certificate owner 



- Requires an existing public key infrastructure (PKI)



# Tokens and cards

- Smart card

  - Integrates with devices 



- USB token 

  - Certificate is read



# SSH keys

- Secure terminal communication



- Use a key instead of a username and password



- Key management is critical



- SSH key managers 



# User Accounts

- An account on a computer associated with a specific person 

  - The computer associates the user with a specific identification number



- Storage and files can be private to that user



- No privileged access to the operating system



# Shared and generic accounts

- Shared accounts are used by more than one person 



- Very difficult to create an audit trail 

  - No way to know exactly who was working 



- Password management becomes difficult 



- Do not use generic accounts 



# Guest accounts

- Access to a computer for guests 

  - No access to change settings, modify applications, view other user's files, and more



- This brings significant security challenges 



# Service accounts

- Used exclusively by services running on a computer

  - No interactive/user access 

  - Web server, database server, etc.



- Access can be defined for a specific service 

  - Web server rights and permissions



- Commonly use usernames and passwords

  - You'll need to determine the best policy for passwords



# Privileged accounts

- Elevated access to one or more systems 

  - Admin, root



- Complete access to the system 

  - often used to manage hardware, drivers, and software installation



- This account should not be used for normal administration



- Needs to be secured

  - 2 factor 

  - Change password frequently



# Account policies

- Control access to an account 



# Perform routine audits

- Is everything following the policy?



- Have audits scheduled 



- Certain actions can be reported so you are informed 



# Auditing

- Permission auditing 

  - Some administrators don't need to be there. 



- Usage auditing 

  - How are your resources used?

  - Are your systems and applications secure?



# Password complexity and length

- Make your password strong

  - Resist guessing or brute-force attack



- Increase password entropy

  - No single words, no obvious password



- Mix upper and lower case and use special characters 



- Stronger passwords are at least 8 characters 



- Prevent password reuse 



# Account lockout and disablement 

- Too many incorrect passwords will cause a lockout

  - Prevents online brute force attacks

  - Should be normal for most user accounts 



- Disabling accounts

  - Part of the normal change process

  - You don't want to delete accounts 

  - Deleted accounts may have encryption keys



# Location-based policies

- Network location 

 - IP subnet based on identity 



- Geolocation 

  - GPS 

  - 802.11 wireless

  - IP address 



- Geofencing 

  - Automatically allow or restrict access 



- Geotagging

  - Add location metadata to a document or file

  - Latitude and longitude, distance, time stamps



- Location-based access rules 

  - Stop outside attacks.
