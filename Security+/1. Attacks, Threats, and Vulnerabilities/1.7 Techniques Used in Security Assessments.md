# Threat hunting

- A constant game of Cat and Mouse, there is always a chase

  - Strategies are constantly changing but Firewalls getting stronger 



- The goal is to always Speed up the reaction time



# Intelligence fusion

- Using sources of threat intelligence data to automate the detection of IoC (Indicator of response)

 - There is an overwhelming amount of security data



- separate teams such as Security operations, Security intelligence, threat response

  - Many data types 



- Security information and event management (SIEM) platform can apply intelligence fusion techniques



# Threat feeds 

- Collect the data; logs and sensors, network information, internet events, intrusion detection 

  - Add external sources; Threat feeds, government alerts, and social media 



# Maneuver 

- The concept that threat actor and defender may use deception or counterattacking strategies to gain positional advantage 

  - Firewall rule, block an IP address, delete malicious software 

  - automate maneuvers; the computer reacts instantly 

  - combine with fused intelligence; ongoing combat from many fronts 



- The hacker will try to distract you with one task but then attack another section 



# Vulnerability scanning

-  Usually minimally invasive; Unlike a penetration test

   - Port scan; poke around and see what's open 



- Identify systems; test from the inside and out

  - Gather as much information as possible



# Non-intrusive scans 

- Gathering information, don't try to exploit a vulnerability



# Intrusive scans

- Find the vulnerability to see if it works 



# Non-credential scan

- The scanner can't log in to the remote device 



# Credentialed scan

- You are a normal user, emulates an insider attack



# Application scans 

- Desktop, mobile apps



# Web applications

- Software on a web server can be vulnerably



# Network scans 

- Misconfigured firewalls, open ports, and vulnerable devices



# Vulnerability research

- National Vulnerability Database

 - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures shows vulnerabilities 

 - Microsoft Security Bulletins 



# Common Vulnerability Scoring System 

- Scores vulnerability from 0 to 10 

  - The scoring standards do change over time



# False positive

- A vulnerability does not really exist after the scan

  - It is different than a low-severity vulnerability



# False negative

- The vulnerability exists, you just couldn't detect it 



# Security information and Event Management (SIEM)

- Logging of security events and information

  - Log collection of security alerts

  - Log aggregation and long-term storage

  - Data correlation 

  - Forensic analysis



# Syslog 

- A protocol enabling different appliances and software applications to transmit logs or event records to a central server

  - Standard for message logging; Diverse system, consolidated log



- Usually a central log collector

  - Requires a lot of disk space



# SIEM data

- Security Information and Event Management ( SIEM )

  - Data inputs

  - VON connections

  - firewall session logs

  - denied outbound traffic flows

  - Network utilizations

  - Packet capture



# Security monitoring 

- Constant information flow 



- Track important statistics



- Send alerts when problems are found 



# Security reports and analyzing the data 

- Over a long period of time, there are security reports

  - Big data analytics; Identify patterns 

  - User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)

  - Sentiment analysis; public discourse correlates to real-world behavior 



# Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) 

- Automate routine, tedious, and time-intensive activities

  - Automation is important because it is faster than humans 



- Orchestration

  - connect many different tools together, firewalls, account management, email filters
