# Zero day

- A vulnerability in software that is unpatched by the developer or an attack that exploits such a vulnerability

  - A vulnerability that has been discovered but the company does not know about 

  - These can be extremely destructive 

 

# Open Permissions

- Users have too many Permissions towards sensitive data

  - Open door where the hacker can just walk on in



- Permissions can be complex and it is easy to make mistakes



- **Example** - 14 million Verizon records exposed; Third-party left an Amazon S3 dta repository open



# Unsecure root accounts

- Root is easy to access which gives the user privileges to do what they want 

  - It is the default admin account 

  - Some Root passwords can be weak 



# Erros

- Errors give too much information to the hacker 

  - Errors can give service type, version information, debug data



- **Example** -Patreon was compromised; debugger to help monitor and troubleshoot website issues



# Weak encryption

- Easy to crack hashes can lead to information being stolen

  - Encryption protocol (AES,3DES)



- length of encryption is important and make sure wireless encryption is used



# Insecure protocols

- Having outdated protocols can lead to vulnerabilities in the network 

  - Some protocols aren't encrypted 



- Verify a packet capture to make sure it is encrypted is a way to see if you have a great protocol. 



# Default settings

- Default settings make it easy for the hacker to get in. Default passwords are a huge vulnerability.



- **Example** Mirai botnet takes advantage of default configurations



# Open ports and services

- Ports that accept packets is an open port 

  - Some open ports can be misconfigured, unpatched, and vulnerable to exploits 



- Make sure firewalls are in place 



# Third-party risks

- I.T security doesn't change because it's a third-party

  - Always plan for the worst; Human error is still a big issue



# System integration

- Professional installation and maintenance 

  - Can be on-site with physical or virtual access 



- Less security on the inside; Port scanners and traffic captures

  - Can run software on the internet network



# Lack of vendor support

- Security requires diligence, it takes the vendor some time to patch a vulnerability. 

  - Vendors are the only ones who can fix the products 



- **Example** Trane Comfortlink 2 thermostats: there were three vulnerabilities in April 2014. The patches were then released in April 2015



# Supply chain

- You cant always control security at a third-party location 

  - Always maintain local security control



- Hardware and software from a vendor can contain malware 

  - Counterfeit hardware is out there



# Outsourced code development 

- Access the codebase which can lead to security issues

  - Cloud-base access 



- Verify security to other systems

  - Test the code security; check for backdoors 



# Data storage

- Consider the type of data; Contact the type of data



- Storage at a third=party location needs encryption

  - Check the input and output



# Improper or weak patch management 

- The update server determines when you patch

  - Test all your apps, then deploy



# Firmware 

- The BIOS of the device



# Operating system

- Monthly and on-demand patches can secure the operating system



# Applications 

- Provided by the manufacturer as-needed



- **Example** Equifax had a data break of 147.9 million and many more. Apache Struts, a patch that was identified on March 7, 2017. Wasn't patched till July 30th



# Legacy platforms

- Some devices remain installed for a long time

 - Legacy devices with older operating systems, applications, middleware may have vulnerabilities



- Maybe running end-of-life software 



# Impacts

- Malicious cyber activity cost between 57 billion and 109 billion in 2016 

  - More than just finances, The company reputation is also damaged



# Data loss

- Vulnerability unsecured databases

  - no password or default password



- internet-facing databases are being deleted

  - Thousands of databases are missing



- **Example** Hacker Overwrites data with the word "meow";  no message or motive



# Identity theft

- Hackers target companies that have personal information

  - Equifax had data stolen in July 2017



# Financial Loss

- Bank of Bangladesh; Society for Worldwide interbank 

  - Attackers set secure messages to transfer nearly one billion dollars 



# Reputation impacts

- Getting hacked isn't a great look



- **Example** October 2016 - uber breach 25.6 million names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers; They paid 148 million in fines



# Availability loss

- Outages and downtown

  - Ransomware can lock your files and down your system
