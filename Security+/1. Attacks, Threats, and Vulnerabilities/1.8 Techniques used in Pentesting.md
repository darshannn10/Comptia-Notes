# Penetration Testing

- A test that uses active tools and security utilities to evaluate security by simulating an attack on a system. A pen test will actively test and bypass security controls.

 - Simulate an attack 

 - Similar to vulnerability scanning; we try to exploit the vulnerabilities

 - Often a compliance mandate; 3rd-party testing



# Rules of engagement 

- An important document should be provided on what to attack 

 - Type of testing and schedule; On-site physical breach, internal test, external test

 

 - The rules

   - IP address 

   - Emergency contacts

   - How to handle sensitive information 

   - In-scope and out-of-scope devices



# Working knowledge 

- How much do you know about the test; many different approaches



-Unkown environment

  - Blind test



- Known environment 

  - Full disclosure



- Partially known environment; A mix of known and unknown, Focus on certain systems or applications



# Exploiting vulnerabilities

- Try to break into the system 

- Gain privilege escalation

  - Buffer overflows can cause instability



# Lateral movement 

- Move from system to system 

  - The inside of the network is unprotected 



# Persistence

- Once you gain access you need to gain backdoor access 

  - Always have a way into the network



# The pivot 

- Gain access to systems that would normally not be accessible

  - Use a vulnerable system as a proxy or relay 



# White box 

- Having all the knowledge of the applications and testing the internal workings



# Black box

- Outside the network with little or no prior knowledge 



# Gray box

- Combination of white and black box testing, Search for defects. 



# Reconnaissance 

- Need information before the attack 

  - Gathering a digital footprint

  - Understand the security posture

  - Minimize the attack area; Create a network map 



# Passive footprint

- The phase-in an attack or pen test in which the attacker or tester gathers information about the target

  - Learn as much as you can from open sources

  - Social media and corporate websites. 

  - Social engineering 



# Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

- Gather information from many open sources

 - Find information on anyone or anything

 -  Data is everywhere 



- Automate gathering which can gather information fast 



# Wardriving or warflying

- The practice of using a Wi-Fi sniffer to detect WLANs and then making use of them using WEP or WPA cracking tools

  - Combine WiFi monitoring and a GPS; search from your car or plane



- Huge amount of intel in a short period of time

  - All of this info can be done for free; Kismet, inSSlDer, wigle.net 



# Active footprinting

- Trying the doors and visible on network traffic

  - Ping scans, port scans 

  - DNS queries

  - OS scans, OS fingerprinting 

  - People can see that we are performing these task 



# Red-team

 - The Offensive security team

   - Ethical hacking; find security holes



- Exploit vulnerabilities

- The hacker gains access



- Social engineering attacks



# Blue team

- Defensive security

  - Protecting data



- Operational security 

  - daily security tasks



- Incident response

  - Damage control



- Threat hunting 

  - find and fix the holes 



- Digital forensics

  - find data everywhere 



# Purple team 

- Red and blue teams work together.

  - Deploy applications and data securely



# White team

- Not on a side, the referees in a security exercise

  - Enforces the rules and resolves any issues 

  - Manages the post-event assessments
