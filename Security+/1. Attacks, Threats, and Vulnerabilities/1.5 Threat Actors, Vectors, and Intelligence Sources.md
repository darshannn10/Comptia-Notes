#  Threat Actors

- The entity responsible for an event that has an impact on the safety of another entity 

  - Broad scope of actors 



# Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 

- Attackers are in the network and undetected

  - on a FireEye report, 71 days in America, 177 days in EMEA, and 204 days in APAC before they are detected



- Insiders

- A type of threat actor who is assigned privileges on a system that cause an intentional or unintentional incident

  - more than just passwords on sticky notes



- Attacks can be directed at the vulnerable system but he knows what to hit 

  - Eats away from the inside, they know everything



# Nation state 

- National security; always an external entity



- **Example** - Highest sophistication; Military, utilities; Stuxnet worm 



# Hacktivist

- A hacker with a purpose; social exchange or political agenda; often external

  - Funds are limited which is a disadvantage



# Script Kiddie

- Runs pre-made scripts without any knowledge of what's happening

  - Can be internal or external 

  - Not very sophisticated 



# Criminal syndicates

- professional criminals That do professional crimes

  - Most always external

  - very sophisticated

  - Crime that is organized 



# Expert with technology

- **White Hat** 

    - Authorized; ethical hacker with good intentions 



- **Black Hat** 

    - Unauthorized; Malicous 



- **Gray Hat** 

    - Semi-authorized; finds a vulnerability but doesnt use it



# Shadow IT

- Computer hardware, software, or services used on a private network without authorization from the system owner

  - Going Rouge; working around the internal IT organization 



# Competitors

- Many different motivations, The competitors want an edge over their competitor 

  - High level of sophistication



- **Example** - Has many different intents; Shut down your computer, steal customers lists, corrupt manufacturing databases



# Vectors 

- **Attack vectors**

    - A method used by the attacker which gains them unauthorized access to a system 



- A lot of works and time goes into finding vulnerabilities in those vectors 



# Direct access

- Physical access to a system is significant 



- Modify the operating system; reset the admin password a few times 

  - Attach a keylogger to collect username and passwords 



# Wireless

- Default login credentials; modify the access point 



- Rouge access point; A less-secure entry point to the network



- Evil twin; emulate the authentication details; man in the middle attack 



# Email 

- Everyone has an email account, It is attractive to hackers

  - Phishing attacks 

  - Social engineering attacks 

  - Deliver malware to the user



# Supply chain 

- Tamper with the underlying infrastructure, There are layers to operations

  - Target was affected by a supply chain attack

  - Malware can modify the manufacturing process 



- **Examples** - Counterfeit networking equipment; install backdoor 



# Social media 

- Attackers thank you for putting personal information online

  - User profiling; Where you were born; what is the name of your school mascot as a security question



- Hackers can pose as Fake friends who try to get additional information



# Removable media attack vectors

- Get around the firewall by USB 

  - Malicious software on USB flash drives; infect air-gapped networks 

  - USB devices can act as keyboards



# Cloud

- Public-facing applications and services

  - Security misconfigurations; Data permissions and public data stores

  - Brute force attacks 

  - Orchestration attacks



# Threat intelligence

- Research the threats

  - Data is everywhere 

  - Make decisions based on what the hackers have researched

  - Used by researchers 



# Open-source intelligence (OSINT)



- Open source; Publicly available sources

  - Internet; Discussion groups, social media

  - Government data

  - Commercial data 



# Closed/proprietary intelligence

- Someone else has already compiled the threat information

  - Threat intelligence services 

  - Constant threat monitoring



# Vulnerability database

- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE); A community-managed list of vulnerabilities; sponsored by the U.S department of homeland Security 

  - Researches find vulnerabilities

  - U.S. National Vulnerability Database



# Public/Private information centers 

- Public threat intelligence

  - often classified information



- Private threat intelligence

   - private companies have resources



- Need to share critical security details



- Cyber threat Alliance (CTA)



# Automate indicator sharing (ALS)

- Intelligence industry needs a standard way to share important threats



- Structured threat information eXpression (STIX)

  - describes cyber threat information



# Dark Web

- Overlay networks that use the internet; Requires specific software such as Tor



- **Examples** Hacking groups and services; Tools and techniques; credit card sales; accounts and passwords 



# Indicator of compromise (IOC)

- A sign that an asset or network has been attacked or is currently under attack

  - Unusual amount of network activity

  - Change to file hash values

  - Changes to DNS data

  - Uncommon login patterns

  - Spikes of reading requests to certain files

  

 # Structures Threat Information eXpression (STIX)

 - A framework for analyzing cybersecurity incidents

   - Allows to see attacks in a timely manner 

   -  Threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection

# Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)

- A protocol for supply codified information to automate incident detection and analysis 



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81980702/120111404-71b54800-c137-11eb-8c8e-f4224020e257.png)



# Predictive analytics

- Analyze large amounts of data very quickly 

  - Find suspicious patterns 

  - Identify behaviors; DNS queries, traffic patterns, location data

  - Creates a forecast for potential attacks 



# Threat Maps

- Animated map showing threat sources in near real-time



# File/core repositories

- Github

- Public code repositories

- Attackers are always looking for this code 



- Threat research 

- Know your enemy

  - A never-ending process and you cant rely on a single source 



# Vendor website

- Vendors and manufacturers; they wrote the software

  - They know when problems are accounted

  - They react when surprises happen; Knows zero-days



# Vulnerability feeds

- Automated vulnerability notifications



- Third-party feeds 



- Roll-up to a vulnerability management system 



# Conferences

- Watch and learn 



- Researchers; new DDoS methods



- Stories from the trenches



- Building relationships 



# Acadenuc journals 

- Research from academic professionals 

  - Evaluations of exisitng security 

  - Detailed post mortem

  - Extremely detailed



# Request for comments

- Published by the Internet Society 



- Not all RFCs are standard documents 



# Local industry groups

- A gathering of local peers

  - Associations 

  - Industry user groups 



# Social media

  - Honeypot monitoring on Twitter



- **Examples** - keyword monitoring; CVE, Bugbounty, 0-day 



# Threat feeds

- Monitor threat announcements 

  - many sources of information 



# TTP
