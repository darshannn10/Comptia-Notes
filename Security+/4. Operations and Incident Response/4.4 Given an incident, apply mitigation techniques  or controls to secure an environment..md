# The endpoint  

- The end-user device 

  - Desktop PC, Laptop, phone, etc



- Many ways to exploit a system

  - OS vulnerability, malware, user intervention 



- Security team has to cover all of the bases 

 

# Application approved/deny lists

- Any application can be dangerous

  - Vulnerabilities, trojan horses, malware 



- Approved list 

  - Nothing runs unless it's approved 

  - Very restrictive



- Blocklist / deny list

  - Anti-virus, anti-malware



- Quarantine

  - Anything suspicious can be moved to a safe area



# Examples of application approval list

- Decisions are made in the operating system

  - Often built-in to the operating system



- Application hash

- Certificate

  - Allow digitally signed apps from certain publishers



- Path

  - Only run the application in these folders 



- Network zone 

  - Apps can only run from this network zone 



# Configuration changed

- Firewall rules

  - Manage application flow 



- Mobile device manager (MDM)

  - Enable or disable phone and tablet functionality



- Regardless of physical location 



- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

  - Block transfer of personally identifiable information (PII)



# Configuration changes

- Content filter/URL filter

  - Limit access to untrusted websites

  - Block known malicious sites

  - Large blocklists are used to share suspicious site URLs



- Updating or revoking certificates

  - Manage device certs



# Isolation

- Administratively isolate a compromised device from everything else



- Network isolation

  - Isolate a remediation VLAN



- Process isolation

  - Limit application execution 

  - Prevent malicious activity



# Isolation 

- On it own isolated VLAN



# Containment 

- Application containment 

  - Run each application in its own sandbox



- Limit interaction with the host operating system and other applications



- Ransomware would have no method of infection



- Contain the spread of a multi-device security event 

  - Disable administrative shares

  - Disable remote management

  - Disable local account access 



# Segmentation

- Prevent unauthorized movement

- Limit the scope of a breach 



# SOAR

- Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response

  - Integrate third-party tools and data sources

  - Make security teams more effective



- Runbooks

  - A linear checklist of steps to perform

  - Step-by-step approach to automation

  - Reset a password, create a website certificate



- Playbook

  - Condition steps to follow; a broad process
