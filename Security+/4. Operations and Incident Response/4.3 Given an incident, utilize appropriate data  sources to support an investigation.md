# Identify vulnerability

- The scanner looks for everything

  - The signatures are the key 



- The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online

  - National Vulnerability Database - nvd.nist.gov

  - Microsoft Security Bulletins 



- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified 



# Vulnerability scan results 

- Lack of security controls

  - No firewall

  - No anti-virus

  - No anti-spyware



- Misconfigurations

  - Open shares

  - Guest access



- Real vulnerabilites 

  - Especially newer ones 



# Dealing with false positives 

- False positives 

  - A vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist



- This is different than a low-severity vulnerability 



- False negatives

  - A vulnerability exists, it wasn't detected 



- Update the latest signatures to get rid of a false signature 



# SIEM

- Security information and event management 

  - Logging of security events and information



- Security alerts

  - Real-time information



- Log aggregation and long-term storage



- Data correlation

  - Link diverse types



- Forensic analysis



# Getting the data

- Sensors and logs

  - Operating systems

  - Infrastrucutre devices

  - NetFlow sensors

- Sensitivity settings

  - Easy to be overwhelmed with data

  - Informational, Warning, Urgent 



# Viewing the data

- Trends

  - Identify changes over time

  - Easily view constant attack machines



- Alerts 

  - IDentify a security event

  - View raw data



- Correlation 

  - View data in different ways



# Network log files

- Switches, routers, access points, VPN concentrators



- Network changes

  - Routing updates

  - Authentication issues

  - NEtwork security issues



# System log files

- Operating system information

  - Extensive logs

  - File system information

  - Authentication details



- Can also include security events

  - Brute force, file changes



- MAy require filtering



# Application log files 

- Specific to the application 

  - Information varies widely 



- Windows 

  - Event viewer / application log



- Linux / macOS

  - Var/log



- Parse the log details on the SIEM

  - FIler out unneeded information

 

 # Security log files

 - Detailed security-related information

   - Block and allowed traffic

   - Exploit attempts

   - blocked URL categories

   - DNS sinkhole



- Security devices

  - IPS, Firewall, proxy



- Critical security information 

 

# Web log files

- Web server access 

  - IP address, web page URL 



- Access errors 

  - Unauthorized or non-existent folder/files 

- Exploit attempts



- Server activity 



# DNS log files

- View lookup requests 

  - Add other DNS queries



- IP address of the request 

- Identify queries to known bad URLs



- Block or modify known bad requests at the DNS server



# Authentication log files

- Know who logged in 

  - Account names

  - Source IP address

  - Authentication method

  - Sucess and failure reports



- Identify multiple failures 



- Correlate with other events 



# Dump files

- Store all contents of memory into a diagnostic file

  - Developers can use this info



- Easy to create from the windows task manager



- Some applications have their own dump file process 



# VoIP and call manager logs

- View inbound and outbound call info

  - Endpoint details

  - Gateway communication 

- Security information 

  - Authentications

  - audit trails



- SIP traffic logs

  - Session intiation protocl 



# Syslog

- Standard for message logging

  - Diverse systems create a consolidated log



- Usually a central logging receiver 

  - Integrated into the SIEM 



- Each log entry is labeled 



- Syslog daemon options

 

# Journalctl 

- Linux has a lot of logs 

  - The OS, daemons, application 



- System logs are stored in a binary format 



- Journalctl provides a method for querying the system journal 



# Bandwidth monitors

- The fundamental network statistic 



- Many different ways to gather this metric 

  - SNMP, Netflow, sflow, IPFIZ



# Metadata

- Data that describes other data sources 



- Email

  - Headers details, sending servers, destination address 



- Mobile 

  - Type of phone, GPS location



- Web 

  - Operating system, browser type, IP address



- Files 

  - Name, address, phone number, title 



# Netflow

- Gather traffic statistics from all traffic flows 

  - Shared communication between devices



- Netflow

  - Standard collection method 

  - Many products and options



- Probe and collector 

  - Probe watches network communication



- Usually a separate reporting app 



# IPFIX

- IP flow information export

  - A newer, Netflow based standard 



# sFlow

- sFlow (Sampled Flow)

  - Only a portion of the actual network traffic



- Usually embedded in the infrastructure 

  - Switches, routers



- Relatively accurate statistics



# Protocol analyzer

- Solve complex application issues 

  - get into the details



- Gather packets on the network



- View detailed traffic information
