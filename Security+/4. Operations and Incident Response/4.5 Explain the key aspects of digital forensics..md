# digital forensics 

- collect and protect information relating to an intrusion 



- RFC 3227 - Guidelines for evidence collection and archiving



- Standard digital forensic process

  - Must be detail-oriented



# Legal hold

- A legal technique to preserve relevant information



- Hold notification

  - Custodians are instructed to preserve data



- Separate repository for electronically stored information (ESI)



# Capture Video

- A moving record of the event 



- Capture the status of the screen and other volatile information



- Don't forget security cameras and your phone



- The video content must be achieved



# Admissinility

- Not all data can be used in a court of law



- Legal authorization

  - Search and seizure of information



- Procedures and tools

  - The correct tools used the correct way



- Technical and academic qualifications



# Chain of custody 

- Control evidence 

  - Maintain integrity



- Everyone who contacts the evidence 

  - Use hashes

  - Avoid tampering



- Label and catalog everything

  - Digitally tag all items for ongoing documentation 



# Recording time offsets

- The time zone determines how the time is displayed

  - Document the local device settings



- Different files systems store timestamps differently

  - FAT : Time stored in local 

  - NTFS : Time stored in GMT 



- Record the time offset from the operating system

  - The windows registry

  - Many different values 



# Event logs 

- System logs

  - Documents important operating system and application events



- Export and store for future reference 

  - Filter and parse 



- Log store 

  - Linux : /var/log

  - Windows : event viewer



# Interviews

- Who might have seen this>



- Not all witness statements are 100% accurate 



# reports

- Document the findings 

  - For internal use, legal proceedings 



- Summary information 



- Detailed explanation of data acquisition 



# Order of volatility 

- How long does data stick around?

  - Some media is much more volatile than others

  - Gather data in order from the most volatile to less volatile



- Most volatile to least volatile

  - CPU

  - ARP cache, process table, kernel statistics 

  - Temporary file systems

  - disk

  - remote logging and monitoring data

  - physical configuration 

  - archival media 



# Disk

- Copy everything on a storage drive 

  - Hard drive,SSD, flash drive



- Drive image preparation

  - Power down to prevent changes  



- Connect to the imaging device 



- Forensic clone 

  - bit-for-bit copy



# Random-access memory (RAM)

- A difficult target to capture 



- Memory dump

  - Grab everything inactive RAM



- Import data



# Swap/pagefile

- Used by different operating systems 



- A place to store RAM when memory is depleted 

  - There's a lot more space on the storage drive 



- Can also contain portions of an application 



- Contains data similar to a RAM dump 



# Operating system

- OS files and data

  - May have been modified



- Core operating system

  - Executable files and libraries

  - Can be compared to later to known-good files 



- Other OS data

  - Logged in users 

  - Open ports 



# Device 

- Mobile devices and tablets

  - A more challenging forensics task



- Capture data

  - Use an existing backup file



- Data 

  - Phone calls

  - Contact information 

  - Text messages



# Firmware

- Extract the device firmware

  - Rootkits and exploited hardware device

  - A reprogrammed firmware or ROM



- Specific to the platform

  - Firmware implementation vary widely 



- Data discovery 

  - Exploit data



# Snapshot

- generally associated with VMS



- Incremental between snapshots 

  - original image is the full backup 

  - Each snapshot is incremented from the last 



# Cache 

- Store data for use later

  - Often used to increase performance

  - Many different caches



- Can contain specialized data

  - CPU cache is very short-term instruction storage 



- Some data may never be used

  - Erased after a specified timeframe or when the cache is full

  - Browser caches are often long-lived 



- Data 

  - URL locations



# Network

- Gather information about and from the network 



- Inbound and outbound sessions 



- Packet data

  - Capture raw network data

  - May include long-term packet captures



# Artifacts

- Digital items left behind

  - Every contact leaves a trace

  - May not be obvious 



# Forensics in the cloud

- Adding complexity to the digital forensics process

  - Cloud technologies



- Technical challenges

  - Devices are not totally in your control

  - There may be limited access

  - Associate data with a specific user 



- Legal issues

  - Laws are different around the world 

  - The rules may not be obvious 



# Right-to-audit clauses

- Common to work with business partners 



- Cloud computing providers

  - Can hold all of the data

  - manage internet access

  - are they secure 



- Right-to-audit should be in the contract 

  - A legal agreement to have the option to perform a security audit 



# Regulatroy/jurisdiction 

- Cloud computing technology appeared relatively quickly 



- Forensics professional must know their legal rights 





- Data stored in the cloud may not be located in the same country ]



- Location of the data is critical   



# Data breach notification laws

- Notification laws 

  - If consumer data is breached, the consumer must be informed 



- Many data breach notification laws 

  - Notification requirements also vary
