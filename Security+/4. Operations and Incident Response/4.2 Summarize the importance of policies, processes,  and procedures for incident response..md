# Security incidents

- User clocks an email attachment and executes malware

  - Malware then communicates with external servers



- DDoS

  - Botnet attack



- Confidential information is stolen 

  - Thief wants money or it goes public 



# Roles and responsibility

- Incident response team

  - Specialized group, trained and tested



- IT security management 

  - Corporate support



- Compliance officers 



# NIST SP8-61

- National Institute of standards and technology



- The incident response lifecycle

  - Preparation

  - Detection and analysis

  - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

  - Post-incident activity 



# Preparing for an incident 

- Communication methods

  - Phones and contact information 



- Incident handling hardware and software

  - Laptops, removable media, forensic software, digital cameras. etc.



- Incident analysis resources



- Incident mitigation software

  - Clean OS and application images



# The challenge of detection

- Many different levels of detail, different levels of perception



- A large amount of "volume"

  - Attacks are incoming all the time

  - How do you identify the legitimate threats 

 

- Incidents are almost always complex 



# Incident precursors

- An incident might occur in the future 



- Web server log 

  - Vulnerability scanner in use



- Exploit announcement 



- Direct threats



# Incident indicators

- An attack is underway

  - An exploit is successful



- Buffer overflow attempt

  - Identified by an intrusion detection/prevention system



- Host-based monitor detects 



- Network traffic flows deviate from the norm



# Isolation and containment

- Generally, a bad idea to let things run their course



- Sandboxes

  - Isolated operating system

  - Run malware and analyze the results



- Isolation can sometimes be problematic 



# Recovery after an incident

- Get things back to normal

  - Remove the bad, keep the good



- Eradicate the bug

  - Remove malware

  - Disable breached user accounts

  - Fix vulnerabilities 



- Recover the system

  - Restore from backups

  - Replace compromised files

  - Tighten down the perimeter



# Reconstitution

- A phased approach 



- Recovery may take months



- The plan should be efficient

  - Start with quick, high-value security changes 



- Later phases involve heavy lifting 



# Lessons learned

- Learn and improve 

  - No system is perfect



- Post-incident meeting



- Don't wait too long



# Answer the tough questions

- What happened



- How did your incident plans work?



- What would you do next time? 



# Exercise

- Test yourselves before an actual event

  - Scheduled update sessions (annual,semi-annual,etc.)

- Use well-defined rules of engagement

  - Do not touch the production systems

- Very specific scenario 

  - Limited time to run the event



- Evaluate the response 



# Tabletop exercises

- Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly



- Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis



- Get key players together for a tabletop exercise 



# Walkthrough

- Include responders

  - A step beyond a tabletop exercise



- Test processes and procedures before an event



- Identifies actual faults or missing steps 



# Simulation

- Test with a simulated event

  - Phishing attacks, password requests, data breaches



- Going phishing 

  - Create a phishing email attack

  - Send to your actual user community 



- Test internal security



- Test the users

  - Who clicked



# Stakeholder management

- Keeping a good ongoing relationship with the customer of IT

  - These can be internal or external 



- Most of this happens prior to an incident

  - Ongoing communication and meetings



- Continues after the incident



# Communication plan

- Get your contact list together 

  - There are a lot of people in the loop



- Corporate / organization

  - CIO / Head of information security



- Internal non-IT



- External contacts

  - System owner, law enforcement



# Disaster recovery plan

- If a disaster happens, IT should be ready 



- Disasters are many and varied

  - Natural disasters

  - Technology or system failures

  - human-created disasters



- A comprehensive plan 



# Continuity of operations planning (COOP)

- Not everything goes according to plan

- We rely on our computer systems

- There needs to be an alternative



# Incident response team

- Receives, reviews, and responds



- Determine what type of events requires a response

  - A virus infection? Ransomware? DDoS



- May or may not be a part of the organizational structure



- Focuses on incident handling

  - Incident response

  - Incident analysis 

  - Incident reporting



# Retention policies

- Backup your data

  - How much and where

  - copies, versions, the lifecycle of data 



- Regulatory compliance

  - A certain amount of data backup may be required



- Operational needs

  - Accidental deletion

  - Disaster recovery



- Differentiate by type and application

  - Recover the data you need when you need it 



# Attacks and responses

- A constantly moving chessboard

  - The rules are also constantly changing



- Response and intelligence teams need assistance



- Understand attacks



- Assess the risk in an organization



# MITRE ATT&ACK framework

- The MITRE corporation 

  - US not-for-profit based in Massachusetts 



- The MITRE ATT&ACK framework

  - https://attack.mitre.org/



- Determine the actions of an attacker

  - Identify the point of intrusion

  - Understand methods used to move around

  - Identify potential security techniques



# Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

- Designed by the intelligence community

  - guide analysts to help understands intrusions

 

- Apply scientific principles to intrusion analysis

  - Measurement, testability, and repeatability

  - Appears simple but it's complex



- An adversary deploys a capability over some infrastructure against a victim

  - Use the model to analyze and fill in the details
